## Quests Summary

Bjorn is a mercenary who has traveled extensively throughout Skyrim. He learned to fight primarily on his own, with some foundational training from his father, an Imperial Legion soldier who died in the Great War against the Thalmor. Bjorn blames the Thalmor for his father's death, which left his mother to raise him alone. His mother, a healer, was killed by bandits when Bjorn was still young. He escaped the attack but held onto the pain of losing his family and has pursued bandits ever since.

Bjorn also had a younger sister. When bandits attacked their home, their mother told Bjorn to flee while she tried to protect his sister. When Bjorn returned, he found his mother dead and his sister missing. Subsequently, Bjorn lived on the streets of Windhelm, struggling to survive.

A year later, Bjorn revisited his village and found it occupied by bandits. Among them, he recognized his house inhabited by a family which included his sister. Bjorn chose not to intervene, believing his sister was better off with her new family rather than facing the hardships of life on the streets with him. It's been 15 years since he last saw her. He carries the guilt of leaving his sister behind, deeming himself a coward.

Meanwhile, Adielle endured captivity and hardship among the bandits. When she reached an age where she could work in the mine, she was torn from the arms of the woman she believed to be her mother, only to discover the true nature of her situation. Seeking revenge, she attempted a dark ritual to kill the orc responsible, Groshak, but the Dark Brotherhood never appeared. With the help of an old orc miner and resident of the Stronghold, she managed to free herself and others from captivity. Setting the village on fire, she even killed the person who raised her as a daughter.

\======================================================================

**Quest: Past Shadows**

Bjorn decides to confront his past and seeks to find out what happened to his sister. With the help of the player, he revisits Nordholm, their former village, only to find it in ruins and overgrown with vegetation, indicating that it has been abandoned for a long time.

Upon arrival, Bjorn is overwhelmed with guilt and regret for not intervening when he had the chance to save his sister. He reflects on the choices he made and the consequences they had on his family.

The player and Bjorn encounter an old orc in the village who reveals more about the atrocities committed by the bandits, including the enslavement of Adielle and other villagers. The orc mentions that Adielle orchestrated a rebellion against the bandits, leading to the destruction of the village and her departure.

Realizing that his sister is alive and has endured unimaginable suffering, Bjorn feels a mix of relief and anguish. He vows to find Adielle and make amends for abandoning her.

The old orc points out that a warrior who knows more about what happened is in Narzulbur, an Orc stronghold. There, they meet Thruzar, an orc who provides them with Adielle's diary, detailing her experiences and her quest for revenge.

Reading Adielle's diary, Bjorn learns about the horrors she endured and the actions she took to free herself and seek justice.

\======================================================================

**Quest: Heart Whispers**

Unaware of Adielle's past, Astrid, leader of the Dark Brotherhood, recruited her under the alias "Little Shadow," drawn by her reputation for vengeance and destruction.

Following the game's quests, the player can encounter Little Shadow in the Dark Brotherhood or the Thieves' Guild as an "associate," whom Delvin asks for help with specific cases.

After some conversation with Little Shadow, Bjorn suspects that she might be Adielle and confronts her, but she denies being Adielle, even after seeing the diary. If the player is a member of the Dark Brotherhood, they may be chosen as "The Listener," and Little Shadow remarks that everything would have been different if the listener existed before. They then decide to resume the search for Thruzar. The orc warrior expresses his suspicions about Chief Mauhulak after finding a suspicious letter. Additionally, he informs the player that Groshak has numerous ebony mines with slave labor, controlled by bandits paid with ebony weapons.

Thruzar also gives a hint about where to go next, the Direclaw Camp. But the only clue they find there is a note instructing them to wait for a shipment of ebony from an unknown mine. Unsure of its importance and with no more leads to follow, Bjorn asks the player for some time to think and suggests they can talk better at an inn.

\======================================================================

**Quest: Fire Bonds**

After some time, Bjorn has an idea to inquire at the docks of Windhelm about the shipment arriving on a ship. At this point, Thruzar, the orc the player met earlier, seeks the help of the player and Bjorn. He left his stronghold due to distrust and is now looking for mercenary work. The player tells Thruzar what they found at the bandit camp, and the orc directs the player to the docks in Windhelm, where they find a contact named Stands-In-Shallows, an Argonian addicted to Skooma. He mentions a suspicious shipment but will only provide more details if the player brings him 10 bottles of Skooma. Thruzar knows where to find them, with Shagra, Thruzar's former lover, who is in trouble at Redwater Den. The player helps Thruzar rescue Shagra, who has been associating with bandits after leaving her stronghold. After some suspicion from Bjorn, they kill the bandits in Rift Watchtower and obtain the skooma from the bandit leader after killing him. With the reunion complete, Thruzar decides to stay with Shagra for a while but offers his help to the player whenever needed.

\======================================================================

**Quest: Darkened Fate**

Stands-In-Shallows points to a name, Ulain, a suspicious Dark Elf who waits near the docks around midnight on certain days. The player finds him there, along with a ship loaded with ebony. At that moment, a shadowy figure (Little Shadow) attacks, targeting the shipments. Unaware of the connection, Ulain asks for help and hires the player and Bjorn as mercenaries to protect him until the next shipment arrives. The player and Bjorn decide to keep Ulain close to uncover his connection with the bandits and Groshak.  
While protecting Ulain, he lets slip some details about the operations in Solstheim and expresses a desire to visit one of the ebony mines with slave labor. In the first mine, Ebondrawn Mine, they find Lorzub, the old orc, and Barni, a little boy who is the son of one of the guards. Upon seeing the boy in the mine, Bjorn becomes enraged and decides to kill all the bandits there. The player must assist him.  
After killing everyone, Bjorn apologizes to the player for being so impulsive and asks them to search for the keys. The quest concludes when the cells are opened and the two main prisoners are freed.

\======================================================================

**Quest: Innocence Protected**

The player must escort the old man and the boy out of the mine, where a scene unfolds revealing Barni's backstory. Lorzub invites them to his current home, the basement of Bjorn's old house in Nordholm, which still remains intact. There, he shares the story of his sons, Groshak and Thurak, as he knows it, though he is mistaken about many things. Lorzub then asks the player to find Thurak in the nearby necromancer cave, Cragwallow Slope.

This quest focuses on Barni and Thruzar's childhood and will be further developed in the future.

\=====================================================================

**Quest: Bloodline’s Secrets**

Bjorn and the player find Groshak's journal in a room with two beds in Cragwallow Slope. The journal leads them to a hidden forge and Thurak, Lorzub's son, who has now become a monster. 

**The journal contains the following information:**

One day, while excavating in the Narzulbur mine, Groshak discovered a tunnel being dug from the other side. This tunnel led to a secret chamber in Cragwallow Slope, where a forge was located. Necromancers were studying a way to use the ebony from the mine to create an altar for Molag Bal. Groshak learned from them about the Lord of Domination and found a book stating that they would need hundreds of ingots to create the altar in the forge. Additionally, they would require the heart of someone killed there and a ritual.

The necromancers planned to enslave the orcs from the mine, as the book specified that the ebony had to be extracted by people in servitude and despair. The book contained details on how to construct the altar. Groshak made a deal with the necromancers: he would forge ebony weapons and distribute them to bandit groups to force common people to mine. In return, he wanted to use the altar to dominate whoever he wished and become a powerful necromancer.

One day, in love with Uglarz, Groshak revealed his plan to her, showing her the forge and weapons. She was horrified and refused to participate. In a fit of rage, Groshak locked her in a cage, intending to use her as a test subject for necromancy experiments. He told everyone she had disappeared while hunting.

Thurak, sensing something was wrong, sought to discover what had happened to Uglarz. He found the passage and rescued her. The two disappeared, or so everyone thought, but Groshak knew that Thurak had rescued her and taken her far away. Some time later, Mauhulakh, without his two cousins to challenge him and in fear of Groshak, agreed to turn the nearby village of Nordholm (Bjorn's village) into a bandit haven and the villagers into slave miners. The bandits also had a bounty letter for Thurak and Uglarz. They found them with a baby, Thruzar, and brought only Thurak back. Groshak made him the first victim of the altar, tearing out his heart and turning him into a monster.

**Continuing the quest:** 

Upon finding Thurak, Bjorn and the player engage in a battle. Thurak, now a strong and violent monster, is defeated, but they hear the sinister laugh and voice of Molag Bal. Thurak grows stronger, and sinister black skeletons appear to aid him. The player, when attacked, faints and wakes up dressed as a miner in an ice mine.

A mine slave speaks to the player as the sounds of battle are heard—it's Little Shadow, who has killed all the bandits and come to rescue the player.

After a conversation, Little Shadow takes the player to a place she calls the Hidden Cabin, where Ulain and Roggvar, Barni's father, are tied up. Little Shadow taunts them, saying she got the information she wanted about the main mine in Solstheim. She tells the player that she is indeed Bjorn's sister and leaves.

The player must now rescue Bjorn, so they free Ulain and Roggvar and head to a new mine, Darkstone Mine, indicated by Ulain. There, they overhear a bandit say that when the slaves arrive in Solstheim, they are killed. Ulain leaves, and the mine overseer asks Roggvar to help with the slaves. Upon seeing this, Bjorn kills Roggvar with a pickaxe. Bjorn and the player then discuss the events and the revelation that Little Shadow is indeed his sister. Bjorn is worried but must wait for a letter from her to find out where she is.

\======================================================================  
    
**Quest: Cold Dread**

Now, after the player talks to Bjorn about Thurak, the monster, they decide to go to Thruzar and tell him the whole truth. They return to the Riften Watchtower but only find Shagra. She explains that Thruzar left because of her Skooma addiction. One day, she went out to buy some, and when she came back, he was gone. She hands the player a letter from Thruzar, addressed to the player, saying he has returned to the Stronghold. Shagra asks the player to take her to Lorzub because she needs his wise counsel, and the stage changes to "Take Shagra to Lorzub."

Upon arriving in Nordholm, the player finds Barni alone. He explains that Lorzub heard screams and went to the Stronghold to help. The old orc is now fighting alongside Thruzar. Barni, visibly worried, tells the player what happened. Shagra offers to stay with Barni while the player and Bjorn go to the Stronghold, as the orcs might be in danger. What the player and Bjorn find is Thurak, loose in the courtyard, fighting Thruzar, Lorzub is already dead, having fallen in the battle. The two of them need to help Thruzar. This time, Thurak can be killed. 

After the fight, the player reveals to Thruzar in an emotional conversation that Thurak was his father. Thruzar tells them that the tunnel leading to the necromancers' lair in the mine has been reopened. They follow the tunnel to kill the necromancers. 

After all of this, the player receives the first letter from Little Shadow, saying that she has arrived in Solstheim but that Ulain had misled her about the location.

\======================================================================

**Quest: Soul Chains**

Little Shadow sends the first message, explaining that she couldn’t locate the mine. She was deceived by Ulain, but during her investigation she uncovered something more troubling: mercenaries are being hired to kill the player and Bjorn. If the player has already completed her side quests, she reveals her true identity as “The Watcher.”

Soon after, three mercenaries are sent after the player. They wield enchanted ebony swords and carry bounty letters signed by Groshak, promising further rewards if they succeed.

That night, the player goes to sleep and, upon waking, finds a note from Bjorn asking them to meet him at the New Gnisis Cornerclub in Windhelm. When the player arrives, they overhear a conversation between Bjorn and Ulain. Bjorn has received a letter from Groshak claiming that his sister, Adielle, is being held captive. Groshak demands the player’s soul in exchange for her life. Bjorn pretends to accept the deal to learn Adielle’s location, then kills Ulain once the truth is revealed. The player confronts Bjorn, and together they set out for the mine.

At the mine, they discover enslaved zombie workers and Solstheim warriors guarding the area with enchanted weapons. After clearing the mine, they uncover a hidden forge. Inside, Adielle is found imprisoned in a cage, reduced to an undead state. Groshak awaits them, accompanied by Uglarz, Thruzar’s mother, also raised as a zombie.

Groshak is surprised to see the player alive. He is a towering orc clad in ebony armor, arrogant and cruel. During the battle, Groshak becomes possessed by Molag Bal, who intervenes directly. Molag Bal declares that Groshak has proven insufficient on his own and that he requires a greater design. He offers to restore Adielle — not as she was, but as a vampire, binding her fate beyond the mortal world. Adielle’s soul, though damaged, is not yet lost.

Molag Bal makes it clear that this is not a bargain meant for the player. Instead, Adielle herself is of value. Interfering will leave her soul trapped in Oblivion, but allowing the ritual will return her to unlife. The player is forced to decide on her behalf, as Adielle is unable to choose in her current state. Bjorn struggles with the decision but ultimately allows the player to decide, admitting that standing still will not save her.

If the player allows the ritual to proceed, Molag Bal withdraws, Groshak is freed from possession, and the battle resumes. Adielle is restored as a vampire and joins the fight against Groshak. After Groshak is defeated, Bjorn secretly binds his soul into a Black Soul Gem, refusing to destroy it outright.

In the aftermath, Adielle survives but remembers little of what happened inside the forge. She is aware only that something fundamental has changed within her. Molag Bal’s presence lingers as a shadow rather than an open threat, and the consequences of Adielle’s transformation are left unresolved — setting the stage for future choices involving trust, redemption, and the lingering influence of the Daedric Prince.

\===========================================================================

**How Adielle Is Freed from Vampirism**

After the events in the forge, Adielle survives as a vampire, returned to unlife through Molag Bal’s intervention. She is no longer a mindless husk, but she is not truly free either — the curse remains, and the shadow of Molag Bal still hangs over her in ways neither she nor Bjorn fully understand.

In the aftermath, Bjorn reveals something he has kept hidden: when Groshak was finally killed, Bjorn bound his soul into a Black Soul Gem. He didn’t destroy it immediately, not out of mercy, but because he feared it might still be useful — either as a weapon, or as a way to undo what had been done to Adielle. At the same time, Bjorn admits the gem is dangerous, because it could tempt Adielle into doing something irreversible, especially with her anger, her past, and her lingering connection to Molag Bal.

Bjorn then gives the gem to the player, making it clear that he will not force a choice: if the player wants nothing to do with it, they can keep it, sell it, or even enchant a weapon with it. But if the player chooses to involve Adielle, the gem becomes a test — not a cruel one, but a necessary one — because what Adielle does with that power will reveal whether she can truly be trusted.

If the player gives Adielle the gem, she recognizes the danger immediately. She admits she doesn’t trust herself the way she used to, and that being a vampire makes Molag Bal’s influence feel closer. Even without directly stating her darkest possibilities, she understands the gem represents temptation as much as salvation. In the end, she chooses to seek a way out instead of embracing power.

That decision leads her to Morthal, where she speaks with Falion, one of the few mages who understands vampirism and soul-binding rituals. Falion explains that reversing vampirism is not simply “curing” a disease — it requires severing the curse at its root. The ritual is dangerous and imperfect: it removes the vampirism and restores Adielle to a mortal body, but it does not erase what Molag Bal has done, nor does it guarantee that his influence is gone forever. It only breaks the active chain.

The ritual succeeds. Adielle returns as a human again, but changed. Molag Bal’s pull is no longer constant, yet she knows only time will tell what scars remain. What matters is that she can finally think without hunger and rage drowning everything else, and she chooses to stay close to the player and Bjorn — because without revenge consuming her, there is finally room to feel something beyond it.

## Bjorn's Main Quest

### **Act \#00 \- The Mercenary Aid**

**Hello**

* Looking for someone to watch your back? I can do it.  
* You look like you've seen better days.

**Combat**

* Take that, scum\!

\======================================================================

#### **First encounter with player in WhiteWatch Tower**

Player:  
\- You're no guard, what brings you here?

Bjorn:  
\- An observant one, aren't you? No, I'm no guard. I'm a mercenary by trade.

Player:  
\- And you're here fighting bandits just because...?

Bjorn:  
\- Let's just say I have a grudge against these bastards. They're a blight on Skyrim, and it's up to me to purge this beautiful land.. And besides, what's the point of a good sword arm if you don't use it, right?

Player:  
\- But aren't mercenaries supposed to get paid?

Bjorn:  
\- aha, you've got me there\! Typically we are. But I'm not opposed to dragging these lowlife's faces in the dirt for free every now and then. Keeps me in good form. My usual rate is 50 septims. Trust me, you won't find a better deal\! Seems like we'd make a pretty good team, doesn't it?

Player:  
\- That sounds fair, but can I trust you?

Bjorn:  
\- Sure, you can trust me\! My deal is simple: if you kick the bucket, I keep all your stuff. And, of course, I want a share of any loot we find, but we can sort that out later.

Player:  
\- I need some time to think it over.

Bjorn:  
\- Take your time. If you decide you want my help, you can find me at the Bannered Mare in Whiterun. That is, unless another exciting opportunity presents itself. Or, if you're ready to get moving, we can start right now. It's up to you.

\=====================================================================

#### **Bjorn tells his whole story to the player (outside of quests)**

His father was a soldier in the Imperial Legion, who died in the great war against the Thalmor, where the White-Gold Concordat was signed. A few years later, his mother raised the two children alone, Bjorn at 15 and Adielle at 3 (she was just a few months old when she lost her father), when a group of bandits invaded the Nordic village, Nordholm. Bjorn's mother was the village healer, knowledgeable in magic, and she tried to protect them, telling Bjorn to run and creating a shield for herself and the child. Bjorn obeyed but felt he shouldn't have and returned shortly after. He found his mother dead, no sign of his sister, and some bandits laughing inside his house, celebrating the plunder.

Several years later, Bjorn, who had gone to Windhelm, where he suffered hunger and cold as an orphaned child, now well-trained for his revenge, returns to the village. He observes the house for a while and realizes that one of the children playing in the room was his sister, playing happily without remembering anything. The woman who pretended to be her mother but was one of the bandits treated her with tenderness, seemed to love her. Bjorn couldn't take that away from his sister and couldn't bring her to suffer like he did, so he left her there and never returned, that was 15 years ago.

**Dialogues with the player**

Player:  
Tell me about yourself?

Bjorn:  
Well... There's not much to tell, really. I'm just a simple mercenary trying to make a living. I've traveled all over Skyrim, It's not the most glamorous life, but it keeps me busy.

Player:  
How did you learn to fight?

Bjorn:  
There weren't many options for me... I had to learn to fight by myself while growing up in Skyrim, you know?  
My father was an Imperial Legion soldier and taught me some basics, but I mostly honed my skills through practice and experience.

Player:  
Can you tell me more about your father?

Bjorn:  
My father fought in the Great War against the Thalmor. He, like many other good men and women, died in the war. It was a senseless conflict that accomplished nothing but death and destruction.

Player:  
Do you blame the Thalmor for your father's fate?

Bjorn:

Aye, I do. The Thalmor took my father from us, and my mother was left to raise me alone. She was a healer and tried her best to protect our village, but she was no match for the bandits who attacked us.

Player:  
Bandits killed your mother?

Bjorn:  
Yes, they did. It was a long time ago, but the pain is still fresh. I've spent my life hunting down bandits ever since.

Player:  
Tell me about yourself?

Bjorn:  
I didn't tell you before, but I had a younger sister. When my mother realized we were under attack, she held my sister close, tried to conjure a barrier to protect us both, and told me to run. I did as she said, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I should have stayed to protect them. When I returned, my mother was dead, and my sister was nowhere to be found.

Player:  
What did you do?

Bjorn:  
There were six men inside our house, laughing and celebrating their victory.So I went to Windhelm... I lived on the streets like a beggar, hungry and cold, doing whatever I could to survive.  
Enough of sad stories my friend, I'll tell you what I did after another time.

Player:  
Have you ever tried to go back to your home?

Bjorn:  
Aye, after a year had passed, I returned to that village and found the same damn bandits living there like they owned the place. My first thought was to slaughter the lot of 'em, but then I saw a man with a wife and children in my house. Maybe he was one of those bandits, and that was his family? I couldn't bring myself to seek revenge on a man and make his innocent family pay for his sins.

Player: "So, about your little sister?"

Bjorn: "Well, things get worse from here. After observing for a while, I realized that one of the children in that couple that was in my house was my sister... apparently happy, playing with the other children... that woman loved her... I spent some time watching them... I didn't want her to live like me, begging on the cold streets, so I left her there and never went back."

Player: "I'm sorry Bjorn, it must have been difficult."

Bjorn: "Yes, it was very difficult, but it's been 15 years now. She must be a grown woman by now. I didn't have the courage to go back there and tell her everything. “

Player: "Can we go there just to take a look, see how she's doing?"

Bjorn: "I think we could, what harm can it do? Seeing her doing well might take some weight off my shoulders... I'll think about it, okay?"

### **Act \#1 \- Past Shadows**

Player: Bjorn, are you okay?

Bjorn: You know, I wasn’t planning on bringing this up, but after our talk about my sister... her name’s Adielle, by the way... I think you might be right.  
Maybe it’s time to visit my old village. Just to see how things turned out. I don’t want to interfere or stir up old memories—just... take a look from a distance.  
Nordholm’s not exactly full of happy memories for me, but with you around, I think I can face it.

Player: Of course, Bjorn. Let's face this together.

Bjorn: Thank you. I knew you'd get it. I appreciate it, truly. It's near Narzulbur, the Orc stronghold. Let's head to Nordholm then.

The player follows Bjorn towards Nordholm, and upon arrival, they find the village devastated, as if it's been a long time since anyone lived there. Vegetation covers the entire area.

#### **Nordholm**

Player: Bjorn, there's nothing left here…

Bjorn: Everything's just... gone... it's nothing ashes and ruins... I... I should have come sooner…

Player: Bjorn, you had no way of knowing…

Bjorn: But the signs were there, weren't they? I knew what those bandits were capable of... and yet, I left her... I left her in their grasp... I'm nothing but a craven, always fleeing…

Player: You're probably right... I value your backing during this tough time... It's quite hard to see this... Look, it looks like there's still someone here, that old orc over there, maybe he knows something.

Player to Lorzub: Can you tell us what happened to this village?

Lorzub: Hmm, you want tale of burnt village... Groshak brought this calamity upon us all. He turned innocents into slaves with the help of bandits, promising them wealth and homes. It was a dark time indeed.  
There was a nord girl, too young for hard labor. She was given to one of the bandit's wives... A cruel fate, to be sure. But when they threw her into the mine, that was the final insult. It shamed us orcs to our core.

Player: A nord girl?\! Please tell me more about it.

Lorzub: Ah... That girl... she was something else. Despite everything, she found a way out... I may be old and lack the courage to seek a 'good death', but I can recognize true courage when I see it. Now, what's your interest in all this, outsider?

Player: I'm trying to piece together a lost history…

Lorzub: Hmph... Is that so? Well, there's more to the tale, but maybe it's not my place to tell it all... Thruzar in the stronghold, he was... closer to the events.  
He might have more to share... If you're really looking to understand, you should talk to him.

Player to Bjorn: She's alive, Bjorn. She survived.

Bjorn: Alive...? I... I can't believe it... She's a survivor, alright. But where is she now?

Player: We can start with this Thruzar in Narzulbur.

Bjorn: Aye, let's not waste any more time then\!

**Arriving in Narzulbur:**

Thruzar: What do you want here, outlander?

Player: Actually, I think Bjorn would better explain…

Bjorn: You must be Thruzar... I'm Bjorn, once of the small nord village nearby, Nordholm. I'm looking for information about a young nord girl who used to live there…

Thruzar: Ah... the girl, Adielle... Fiery spirit, that one. I've never seen someone so young carry such a heavy burden... She was thrown into a situation no child should face...   
Groshak, that twisted Orc... had a stranglehold on this nearby village.... He made life hell for the girl and everyone else. He was banished from these lands after the horrors he inflicted came to light.

Bjorn: Adielle... that's my sister's name\! You assisted her? My gratitude is boundless... But please, where did she go afterwards?   
Do you have any additional details about what that beast Groshak did? Was he responsible for my mother's death? Do you know about that too?

Thruzar: Your sister? Your mother? By the stones of Malacath... Everyone thought you had fallen, Bjorn\! There's a diary, with me, but it's entrusted under an oath to Chief Mauhulakh…  
He doesn't want this story spreading. It's a mark of disgrace upon us... But he also decreed it can only be read by those accepted as Blood-Kin…  
Go, get the Chief's acceptance. Once you're acknowledged, the diary is yours... I promise.

**Idles**

So, we’re off to find the Forgemaster’s Fingers. I hope they’re not still attached to the Forgemaster. That could get awkward.

I wonder if the Orcs would accept a replica instead. We could always tell them the original got... misplaced.

**Hello**

Groshak... I want to know everything about him. How he twisted the lives of those I cared about... and why.

**After a vanilla quest, Player turned a Blood-Kin:**

Player: I'm a Blood-Kin, can you give me the diary?

Thruzar: You're a Blood-kin? Well, that changes things. As a member of our kinship, you've earned my trust and that of our stronghold. Here, take the diary...   
Be prepared, it's all in there... and we'll try to forget that this ever happened. If you find Groshak, I hope you rip his head off.

Player to Bjorn: Bjorn, here it is. Best read it carefully.

Bjorn: Thank you. This... It might be difficult to read, but I need to know. I need to understand what she went through.

#### **Adielle’s Diary**

(Morning Star, 15\)  
"Dear Diary,  
Today, I found a pretty rock by the river. It shines when the sunlight touches it. I've decided to keep it; maybe it holds some magic. 

I dreamed again. The same dream where a sweet voice sings lullabies to me and a bright-eyed boy plays at my side. I shared it with Mama. She smiled and called dreams 'whispers of the heart'. Mama is kind. But when I wake up, I miss the voice in my dreams. It feels like I should remember her... know her. I wonder if dreams are real or mere fantasies. But I cherish them. In my dreams, everything is bathed in love and warmth."

(Sun's Dawn, 12\)  
"Dear Diary,  
The dreams twist and turn. The sweet voice sobs now, and the boy... he looks lost. These dreams distress me, making me feel hollow. 

The other children are distant. They have their families. Mama says not to fret, but I can't help it. I yearn to know why I am different. A man visits sometimes. His gaze is fierce, wolf-like. He talks about a mine with Mama. He scares me."

(First Seed, 25\)  
"Dear Diary, I overheard a harsh conversation. The man with wolf eyes was back. He roared about the mine and workers. His words were tangled, but one was clear \- "slaves". Mama was crying. I'd never seen her cry. It felt as if my nightmares were seeping into reality. "

(First Seed, 30\)  
I'm in the mine now. It's a pit of cold and darkness. I long for home... A lady here told me things... about my real parents... about my brother. I feel a rage building inside. Everything is a lie. Mama isn't my mother. The man with the wolf eyes, he's a monster named Groshak.

(Rain's Hand, 10\)  
"Change is inevitable. Groshak, he's the puppeteer of our misery. I've heard about a group, the Dark Brotherhood. They're said to end lives upon a certain ritual's completion. I've begun gathering the needed items. 

I performed the ritual \- the Black Sacrament. The Brotherhood should find me now. I've prayed for them to slay Groshak. This ends now."

(Mid Year, 20\)  
"The Brotherhood didn't come. Despair has gripped me. But I can't succumb. I need to find an escape. I overheard guards talking about keys... I need to procure them. The uprising is tomorrow.

 I possess the keys, the men, and the rage. We will lock them in and set the houses ablaze. They will feel our torment."

(Last Seed, 1\)  
"It's accomplished. The village is reduced to ashes. The bandits are lifeless. The slaves are liberated. But nothing remains here for me. I'll leave tonight."

(Hearthfire, 15\)  
"I'm leaving you amidst these charred remnants of my past. If anyone stumbles upon this, know this \- my name is Adielle. I refuse to be a victim or a slave. I will carve my place in this world."

**Bjorn reads the diary, stays quiet for a while until both the player and he are safe and comfortable.**

Player: Are you okay, Bjorn?

Bjorn: Am I okay? No, I'm not okay. I'm furious... heartbroken. I left my little sister behind, in a hell that I can't even begin to comprehend…

Player: Calm down, Bjorn. What did you read?

Bjorn: Indeed... I need to stay steady... It... It tells her tale. Of suffering, confusion... despair. She was raised by the same bandits who put an end to our mother's life…  
She spent her childhood thinking she was in the arms of our mother until that fiend grabbed her, tossing her amidst those poor helpless beings…  
By the gods... A dreary cave filled with desolate lives... I cannot even conceive such horror…  
You see... She sought the Dark Brotherhood's assistance, how on Nirn did she get hold of that book? It was her desperate cry for help, but they never showed up...   
I must seek her out, perhaps she is still in need of me, and mark my words, when I find this beast Groshak, I'll make sure he regrets not perishing that day.

Player: I'm sorry, Bjorn... We don't know where they are.

**If the player has not met Little Shadow:**

Bjorn: True... The worry is weighing heavy on me... If only I had some hint of her current place...   
Hopefully, our travels might lead us to something... What do you think we could do now? I mean, she performed the Black Sacrament... someone must have heard about it. Maybe one of those guilds that work in the shadows... or perhaps we could go back and talk to Thruzar?

Player (option 1): We could try the Dark Brotherhood or the Thieves Guild.

Bjorn: Yes... both guilds thrive on secrets, don't they? They may have heard whispers... How about we start there when we get a chance?

Player (option 2): We could find Thruzar and ask him more questions.

Bjorn: Yes, Thruzar did know quite a bit about what happened, didn't he? Perhaps he has more information he hasn't shared yet...Should we ask him more questions and see if he can point us toward the right path?

**If the player has already met Little Shadow:**

**The quest ends and starts next**

### **Act \#2 \- Heart Whispers**

This quest has a follower, it's Adielle, but neither the player nor Bjorn knows it. At some point, they will question, but depending on the stage, she may deny it. Here she uses the codename “**Little Shadow.**"

#### **This stage has 3 timelines depending on the player's action:**

##### **01 \- If the player accepts Astrid's proposal and joins the Dark Brotherhood, Little Shadow will be there:**

Player to Astrid: Anything else I should know?

Astrid: Ah, and there's one more thing. Our 'Little Shadow' over there... She's young, but don't underestimate her. She's been itching to see more action...   
I was thinking you two might work well together. Why don't you go and introduce yourself?

Little Shadow: You're new here... not sure if that's good or bad yet.

Player: What can you tell me about yourself?

Little Shadow: Why should I spill my life's story to you, huh? Well, if you really want to know... I'm Astrid's right hand. Her 'little shadow', she calls me...  
Astrid mentioned someone 'special' would be coming around. I had my doubts, but if it's you, she suggested I might tag along...  
See what all the fuss is about. But only if you're okay with it, of course.

She follows the player from here.

**Bjorn and Little Shadow:**

Bjorn: Oh great... Who are you?

Little Shadow:  
The 'Little Shadow'. That's what they call me.

Bjorn:  
Haha "Little Shadow"? Sounds like a children's bedtime story. How about "Wisp"? As insignificant and fleeting as a puff of smoke.

Little Shadow:   
Watch your tongue, lout... I've killed for less than that.

Bjorn:  
Is that so? Threats aren't new to me, Wisp. Careful who you're talking to.

Little Shadow:  
Charming… and who might you be, besides an annoying presence? 

Bjorn:

If Dark Brotherhood first: Name's Bjorn... Doubt it means much to you, but I've got little patience for this 'brotherhood' of yours, yeah? Keep that in mind... I'll be watching closely.

If Thieves Guild first: The name's Bjorn. It probably doesn't mean a thing to you, but my tolerance for your "guild" and its antics is thin, yeah?  Keep that in mind... I'll be watching closely.

Little Shadow:  
Ah, you're right, I couldn't care less... But let's just move on, shall we?

Bjorn (para o player):  
Hmph... Be careful with this one.

##### **02 \- If the player enters the Thieves Guild first**  Before the player enters the Guild:

Why don't you go pester someone else, in another place? Doubt you'll find anyone in this place who cares.  
Look, if you're searching for friends, you're in the wrong spot.  
You seem lost, but not the kind of lost I help with.

After the player enters the Guild:

Little Shadow:  
Ah, I've heard about you... Delvin mentioned Brynjolf's got a new recruit under his wing. And look at that, I happen to be free at the moment. So, if you need help with anything—\*anything\* at all, just ask.

She follows the player from here.

**Diálogo de Adielle com o Player (Get Stage 30\)**

Adielle:  
Who's the big, brooding fellow? A bodyguard of yours?

01 \- Player:  
"A mercenary I hired. Useful, huh?"  
Adielle: Seems it. Just make sure he doesn't become a problem, alright? The Brotherhood isn't known for patience.

02 \- Player:  
"An old friend and hired blade."  
Adielle: Friendships can be fragile, I suggest he keeps his opinions to himself. Emotions can be... distracting in our line of work.

03 \- Player:  
"More than a mercenary. He's dear to me."  
Adielle: That's sweet. Just remember we have rules, and personal attachments can be... problematic.

**(Set Stage 40\)**

**Scene 02 \- (Get Stage 40\)**

Bjorn:  
So, Wisp, this is the kind of work you and your brotherhood are into? Ending lives for a bit of coin?

Adielle:  
How is it any different from what you do, huh? You take contracts, fight for those who pay you. Isn't it all the same?

Bjorn:  
It's different. As a mercenary, I fight in battles, defend those in need. There's a code.

Adielle:  
Oh, so you think there's 'honor' in bloodshed as long as it's out in the open? You're wrong... The Dark Brotherhood doesn't just kill. We're guided, chosen by the Night Mother.

Bjorn:  
There's nothing honest about sneaking in the dark and slitting someone's throat. Worshipping some dead 'Mother' doesn't make it righteous.

Adielle:  
Calm down, brute. You're speaking blasphemy. The Night Mother is not just any deity... she's a force, a presence. She is our guide, our purpose, and our salvation.  
And there's nothing noble about pretending to be righteous when, at the end of the day, we both have blood on our hands... At least I know I serve a higher power.

Bjorn:  
Look, this isn't a contest of righteousness\! I despise what you're doing here. But I won't waste my breath arguing faith with a damn zealot.

**(Set Stage 50\)**

**Player with Little Shadow \- Get Stage 50**

Player:   
Why did you join the Dark Brotherhood?

Little Shadow:  
Nobody simply 'joins' the Brotherhood. It's... a calling. Most of us didn't choose this path. It chose us.

Player:  
1 \- So, you're saying you were... forced into this?  
2 \- What's your story then? How did this happen?

Little Shadow:  
1 \- No, not forced. It's complicated. The Brotherhood finds you when you've reached a certain... darkness in your life. It becomes a sanctuary, a place to belong.  
2 \- It's a tale for another time... All you need to know is that I've seen the depths of despair, and the Brotherhood was the hand that pulled me out.

Player:  
Sounds like you've been through a lot.

Little Shadow:  
Sadly yes. Well, perhaps someday I'll share it with you in full. But for now, know this: who I was... that person died long ago. Astrid and the Brotherhood is all I have now.

**(Set Stage 60\)**

**Player with Little Shadow  \- Get Stage 60**

Player:  
"Little Shadow?" Did Astrid give you that name?

Little Shadow:  
Yes, she did. When I first joined the Brotherhood, I was... different. Smaller, quieter, always lurking in the shadows. I guess the name just... stuck.

Player:  
Got it... But what's your real name?

Little Shadow:  
Names have power, and the past is a dangerous thing. There's a reason I left it all behind.

Player:  
Come on, why the secrecy?

Little Shadow:  
Let's just say... sometimes we have to burn away the old to rise anew from the ashes. And that's all I'll say on the matter, for now.

**(Set Stage 70\)**

**Bjorn with player \- Get Stage 70**

Player:  
You were pretty tough on Little Shadow earlier.

Bjorn:  
Look, I know I've been a bit harsh on Wisp... Little Shadow or whatever she calls herself. But it's because I see something in her, something that reminds me of... well, myself in some dark times.  I don't like this Brotherhood business, but it's clear she's here because of some pain. Maybe I went about it the wrong way, but I just want to see if there's a chance to pull her out of this mess.

Player:  
1 \- It's unlike you to get so involved.  
Bjorn:  
It's not about being involved, you know? I've seen too many lost souls in my time, and I've been on the edge myself. If there's a chance to make a difference, even if it's just one person, I'd like to think I'd take it.

2 \- So you're softening up to her?  
Bjorn:  
Softening? Nah... Maybe just recognizing some familiar pain. We all have our ghosts. Sometimes it's easier to face them when someone's got your back.

**(Set Stage 80\)**

**Scene Bjorn and Adielle \- Stage 80**

Bjorn:   
Hey, Wisp... I've been watching you. There's a deep sadness in your eyes, like you're somewhat dead inside. Maybe because of this life you chose?

Little Shadow:  
It's not about the life I chose, Bjorn. It's about the life that was taken from me. This... is all I have left.

Bjorn:  
Well... Everyone has a past, you know? But drowning in it, letting it define you, that's a choice.

Little Shadow:  
Maybe you're right. But some waters are harder to escape from than others.

Bjorn:  
Yeah, I can understand it... but I like to think that, even in the darkest waters, sometimes all you need is someone to throw you a lifeline.

Little Shadow:  
Yes, but sometimes there's no one around when you need that lifeline... Tell me, would you throw one my way if I needed it, Bjorn?

Bjorn:  
Ha... I've got strong arms, Wisp. If you ever need them.

**(Set Stage 90\)**

**Little Shadow receives a letter from Astrid \- Get Stage 90**

This stage will also start when Bjorn talks about Nordholm

Force Greet with player

Little Shadow:  
I received a letter from Astrid...

Player:  
I didn't see any courier, what is it about?

Little Shadow:  
"It was... private. She's requested my presence back at the sanctuary. There are some matters she needs to discuss with me. I'll see you there, okay?"

**Banters Stage 90**

Bjorn: "You know, Wisp, there's someone in Riften who can change your face. Maybe you should think about wearing a smile more often?"

Little Shadow: "Have you tried it? That goofy look on your face looks like someone's not-so-handy work."

\===========

Little Shadow: "There should be a potion to silence someone forever, wouldn't that be great?"

Bjorn: "If there was such a thing, I'd buy a whole barrel."

\===========

Little Shadow: "Bjorn, have you ever thought about putting some bells on your boots? You might just make an even bigger racket when you walk."

\==========

\======================================================================

Little Shadow and The Listener 

**Right after the player discovers they're The Listener.**

Little Shadow: The Listener... It's as if Sithis delights in life's little games. Everything might've changed had you come earlier.

Player: I suppose so. What are you referring to?  
Little Shadow: When I was younger, I made a silent plea in a place of darkness... It seems even the Void can be deaf at times. But here you are, finally answering a long-forgotten call.

Player: Forgotten call? You're speaking in riddles.

Little Shadow: It's just the past whispering, nothing more. Let's focus on the task at hand, shall we? I'm off to handle a few contracts, see you afterward.

/\*  
**Set Stage 100 \- Adielle Dismissed**

**Bjorn to player (get stage 100\)**

Bjorn:  
You know, it's strange how Little Shadow just up and left like that. No warning, no goodbyes. It's like she vanished, like... well, like a wisp.  
\*/

**After Nordholm quest:**

Player: I have to ask you something, Bjorn.

Bjorn: Of course, go ahead.

Player:  
1 \- About Little Shadow…

Bjorn:  
1 \- It seems so obvious now, by Talos\! How did I not see it before? Little Shadow could be my sister, couldn't she?

Player:  
1 \- It's quite possible, isn't it? Maybe Astrid found her after all.  
2 \- I did wonder about that at some point, I must admit.

Bjorn:  
1 \- Yes, because of the Black Sacrament she performed. Astrid had a way of finding out about such things... I bet an entire village set ablaze by a young girl would definitely catch her attention, wouldn't it?  
2 \- I might not have believed you earlier... it seemed like too much of a coincidence, didn't it? But yes, Astrid would have found her... I bet an entire village set ablaze by a young girl would have caught her attention.

**The player returns to the Sanctuary and encounters Little Shadow**

Player:  
Little Shadow, I have an important matter to discuss.

Little Shadow:

1 \- Sure, let's go... this better be important, I have other things to do.  
2 \- Alright, what is it, Bjorn? I'm curious. Just hope you two aren't pulling my leg.

Bjorn:  
Well... I... I've got something to show you, and it might be a bit difficult... This is a diary... I want you to look at this carefully, it's important to me. Was it written by you?

Little Shadow:

This... No, this isn't mine. I don't know what you're trying to pull here, but you're mistaken… Look, I see this means a lot to you, but I can't help you with this.

Bjorn:   
Oh, sorry... I'm just looking for my sister, you know?... She... She wrote this, and I thought you might be her…

Little Shadow:  
I've heard about your search... but... you can't go around bothering every troubled girl in Skyrim, Bjorn... Let me keep it, though... I'd like to read it... It sounds interesting and... dark.

Bjorn: No... I can't do that... And to be honest, I'm not sure I believe you…

Little Shadow:  
Belief is a funny thing, isn't it? You can hold onto it, or let it go. The choice is yours.

Bjorn:   
Oh Gods... this just seems to be getting worse…

\====================================================================

##### **03 \- If the player destroys the Dark Brotherhood** 

Little Shadow seeks revenge for Astrid's death and goes after the player. She finds the player within one of the cities; from afar she says:

"Damn filth\! Prepare yourself."

And then attacks the player\! If the player lets Bjorn die at her hands, the quest ends, and the player has the chance to kill her, thus ending the mod.

If the player wins, she says:

Enough\!\!\!\! Let's talk... please…

Player: What in Nirn was that?\! Are you insane?

How could you? Astrid was my family... Something you've taken from me yet again\! I'll kill you\! You, you've both... left me with nothing... again... This... This isn't the end... There are things you need to understand...

Bjorn: “Wow... That was intense, huh? Do you think she'll come back?”

Player: I think so\! It seems like we owe her something.

Bjorn: What was she on about, saying 'you took everything from me again?' And including me in that? Ha, I swear, I've never laid eyes on her before... But I'm here to guard you, right? And It's not like it's your first dance with death, is it? You're used to this by now.

OR

Bjorn: We should've seen this coming, shouldn't we? Astrid meant a lot to her. It's no surprise she's taking it hard… But, I'm here to protect you, and you did what had to be done... We can't second guess ourselves now…

\=====================================================================

**Thruzar is now at the inn in Falkreath:**

Thruzar: You're blood-kin now. And we orcs, we defend our kin. Word's reached that cursed Groshak about our talk and that diary handover. Makes me question Chief Mauhulakh's ties with him. I fear for my hide.

Player: Why are you so afraid?

Thruzar: Our old orc friend, he's vanished. I've pulled back from the stronghold for now, till I figure things out.  
Found a note in the Chief's quarters, from Groshak. Here, take it. But listen, Groshak's still a plague in Skyrim. Got ebony mines, slaves bending to his every whim. His bandits, armed with ebony. That's how he keeps them loyal.

Player: Oh, that’s terrible. Where should we start?

Thruzar: Start near Direclaw Camp. Orc whispers say Groshak's men hide there. If I hear of more places, I'll send word. Want him to pay for all he's done. Counting on you and Bjorn. I'll keep an eye out for Adielle too, promise.

**Groshak's letter to Chief Mauhulakh:**

“  
Mauhulakh,

Watch who you trust. Not all in your stronghold stand as loyal as you. Would be a shame if certain truths slipped out and brought chaos. Remember what's at stake.

Groshak  
“

**Now when leaving the inn they are surprised by bandits with a letter telling them to kill Thruzar**

**The three bandits had a letter in their pockets from Groshak:**

**“T**o the dog reading this,

Track Thruzar. Kill any fools that stand with him. If they're with the girl, snatch her up and bring her to me untouched. Do this and there's extra coin for you. Fail, and you'll wish you hadn't.

Groshak”

**Direclaw Camp**

**They kill the bandits and find a note inside the chest:**

**“**Wait for the ebony shipment from Drakenvein Mine. Once secured, bring it to our arranged spot immediately. No delays. No mistakes.

Groshak  
**“**

Player: "Bjorn, take a look at this note."

Bjorn:  
"Oh... that cursed fiend... Groshak's deeds make Thruzar's notion of beheading him sound merciful. Every day he extends his grasp, his influence, and people suffer."

Player:

1 \- "Had you ever heard of this mine before?"  
2 \- "Do you think Adielle could be at this mine?"

Bjorn:

1- "No, I haven't. There are many mines throughout Skyrim, but this one is new to me. Maybe it's been kept hidden for a reason.  
2 \- "I pray she isn't... But if he's laid a finger on her, there won't be a cave deep enough in Skyrim where he can hide from my wrath."

Let me think about this... Let's rest at the inn for now, and we can talk when we have a chance, alright?

**When they are relaxing at the Inn:**  
Bjorn: Listen, if you don't mind, I'd like to take a look at the docks in Windhelm... Maybe we'll find someone or something related to that ebony shipment they were expecting…  
It seems like the obvious choice, I suppose, given where they were... someone might know something, I guess. Sorry, I'm not full of brilliant ideas.

\=====================================================================

### **Act \#3 \- Fire Bonds**

Thruzar: You know, it's pretty easy to find you, Blood-Kin.

Player: Thruzar? Again? Are you following me?

Thruzar: Eh... no? I was over in Largashbur, but their troubles dwarf mine, so now I'm trying my hand at mercenary work. Looking for some help, Blood-Kin?

Player: Hm, a note... Let me see what it says… A shipment of ebony? I have a contact at the docks; she could provide some insights... Never heard of the mine, though.

Bjorn: That's exactly what I was saying... we should look for information at the docks. You showed up just in time, friend.

Thruzar: Seems like the winds of fate are in our favor today, Bjorn. Let's get to those docks then.

**Stage 30 \- Find Stands-In-Shallow at the docks in Windhelm**

Thruzar: Stands-In-Shallows... never thought I’d cross paths with you again.

Stands-In-Shallows: Hum... swamp's muck... Thruzar... Fortune doesn't favor me, does it?... Don't you think you've gotten me into enough trouble already?  
Thruzar: Look, I'm not here for old times. I need information, and you're going to give it to me, or I'll start peeling those scales off your face… My friend here is on the hunt for some bandits. Do something useful with your miserable life for once and help us out.

Stands-In-Shallows: Oh, always with the threats... Help your Nord friend? Since when do Nords roll out the welcome mat for us? 

Bjorn to Stands-In-Shallows: Sorry, but I've got nothing to do with this.

Stands-In-Shallows to Bjorn: Yes, but you do nothing to change that.

Stands-In-Shallows to Thruzar: You're pulling my tail, right? And remember the last time I helped because of your growling? I nearly ended up a dead man.

Stands-In-Shallows to player: But this other pal of yours, he's got a bit of a sparkle, not like you lot of mudwalkers... Maybe 100 septims will clear the mud off my memory.  
Look, friend, if you want the good stuff, it's not coming for free. How about you slip me some coin?  
Say, 100 septims, and I'll tell you everything you need to know.

Player:  
1 \- Here's 100 septims. Now, start talking.  
2 \- Help me now, I'll owe you one. (Persuade)  
3 \- Talk now, or things get ugly.(Intimidate)

Stands-In-Shalows: Good... Well, there's a ship comes around... Always brimming with shady sorts, unloading crates at night.  
They haul 'em off down the shore by cart when it’s darkest. I can tell you when it’s due next, but only for a price… I need 10 bottles of skooma, got it? Heh, wouldn't want to risk my neck for less…

Player:  
What? I've paid already\! Where would I get that?

Stands-In-Shallows: Haha, why don't you ask your Orc friend over there? He's got some rather... interesting acquaintances.

Player talk to Thruzar:

#### **Scene Bjorn and Thruzar**  Bjorn: "Skooma and girls, huh? I had you pegged all wrong, Thruzar."

Thruzar: "And what did you figure, Bjorn? That I was just freezing my tusks off night and day at the stronghold?"

Bjorn: "Well, not exactly... I guess I didn’t piece it together. By the way, where’s your home?"

Thruzar: "Haha, well, about that—I don’t exactly stay put. One of these days, I’ll fill you in."

**Redwater Den**

Shagra: Cough... Thruzy... that you? Hmm, no... can't be…

Thruzar: Yes, Shagra, it’s really me. By Malacath, you’ve gotten worse.. Let me help you.

Shagra: Oh, there's so much I need to tell you... but not here. I need some fresh air.

Thruzar: Can we get her outside, Blood-kin? She needs it.

**Outside Redwater Den**

Player: Are you okay?

Shagra: Yes, I think so... Thanks for getting me out of there, it was too close for comfort.  
Well, where do I start... after Thruzar left me, I ran into some folk not far from here, at Rift Watchtower.Things turned nasty quick.

Player: Hmm, what sort of people were they?

Shagra: Humph... Just some bandits…

Bjorn: What? Mixing with bandits, lass? That’s a dangerous path... You aren't leading us into a trap, are you?

Shagra: I was never one of them... They just... took me in when I had nowhere else to go...

Thruzar: Hold on, Bjorn. She was just trying to survive. It's not like she had many choices…

Bjorn: But bandits are never the right choice. They attack innocents. Are we just supposed to ignore that?

Shagra: Listen, lad... I'm not one of them. I got caught up, that's all...I've left things behind there, and truth be told, I don't care what happens to those brutes, but... I'll stay back here while you handle it.

Thruzar: See? I know her; she wouldn’t get mixed up with that trash. I regret ever leaving her behind... Let’s go and settle this once and for all.

Bjorn to player: Well, it looks like the choice is yours again... But what about the skooma?

**Talk to Shagra about the skooma**

Player: Shagra, do you know where we could get 10 bottles of skooma?

Shagra: Funny you should ask... Here you are, judging me. I just finished my last one, but I know they have it. Talk about fate's irony—it's the same person you're going off to kill.

**After Kill the Bandits**

Shagra: I knew you could do it\! I heard Thruzar call you Blood-Kin... Is that true?

Player: Yes, I was accepted among them after a courage trial.

Shagra: "Humph... it’s because of those traditions that I ended up here."

Thruzar: "Don’t blame Malacath for your troubles, Shagra\! You could have stayed at the stronghold; you chose to leave."

Shagra: "Yeah, and my choices were what? Toil in the mines or become one of the chief’s wives? I’m a blacksmith, Thruzar\! My mother raised me for that."

Thruzar: "And what did you expect me to do? Losing you hurt, but what happened afterward was worse, wasn’t it?"

Shagra: "If you had enough courage, you could have been chief\! Then I could have worked at the forge\!"

Bjorn: "Well, it's clear you two have a lot to sort out, don’t you? I think this tower is a good place for you for now. It even has an Orcish touch\!"

Thruzar: "Hmm... you're right. I think I need to stay here a bit longer, keep my girl safe from any backlash. I’ll be here when you need me, Blood-Kin, just give us some time, alright?"

Bjorn: Right then, we should head over to the lizard before he disappears into the swamp or something, aye?... sorry to rush you…

Shagra: Wait... Before you go, I want to give you something. I forged this necklace back when I still had the forge's fire. It’s not much, but it's sturdy and true... like my thanks to you. Keep it, as a token of my gratitude, Blood-Kin.

\======================================================================

### **Act \#4 \- Darkened Fate**

Stands-In-Shallows: Ah, excellent, smooth and timely. So, just saw a man pass by not long ago. His name's Ulain. He usually hangs around a spot near here, waiting for the ship to come in.

Player: "I thought you'd know about the ship... Now I have to look for a man?"

Stands-In-Shallows: "What an odd time to start doubting me, eh? Look, I told you what I know, now do as you please. And remember, the ship only shows up there after midnight. Keep your eyes peeled."

#### Find Ulain after midnight

Bjorn: Actually, I've seen him around... A brooding sort who spends days at a stretch in New Gnisis Cornerclub. Always wondered what he was waiting for there.

**After Little Shadow’s attack**

Ulain: "Wait, who are you? Did you see that? Listen, I want to make you an offer…"

Player: "Uh… What kind of offer?"

Ulain: "You look strong... I need mercenaries. This isn’t the first time this has happened, you know? I’ve heard rumors of a shadow striking shipments before. I want you to protect me from it until another ship arrives. Look... I’ll give you, say, 1000 septims?"

Player: "Right… just a moment… I need to talk to the other mercenary..."

(Player approaches Bjorn)

Player: "Bjorn, did you hear that? He mentioned a shadow…"

Bjorn: And if she’s targeting these bandits, there's got to be a reason, right?... I can't see any beyond the obvious ones... What do you reckon? Keeping him close might give us some answers, and he might just make good bait\! Plus, pocketing a few extra coins wouldn't hurt either, eh?

Player to Ulain:   
1 \- "We accept your offer, but we want payment upfront."  
2- "We don't need you, burn in Oblivion."

Ulain:All upfront, eh? That's a steep ask under the circumstances... How about this: I'll give you 500 septims now, and the other 500 once we're through with this ordeal. That should cover your initial troubles and keep my purse from running dry too soon

   
Player:  
And so, where do you want to go?

Ulain: Well... since I won't be making it there anytime soon, I might as well take in some sights…

Player: Making it where?

Ulain: Solstheim\! Where else... But first, could we swing by New Gnisis Cornerclub? I could use a break.

**Bjorn converses with Ulain**

Bjorn:  
So, Ulain, you mentioned Solstheim. What’s your business there?  
Ulain:  
Mercenaries shouldn't ask too many questions.  
Bjorn:  
I'm just trying to get a sense of what we're up against. For all I know, you might have a lot of enemies. I need information.  
Ulain:  
Well, don’t worry. Since I took over, things have been running smoothly. When my brother Falas was in charge... let's just say he's a bit of a lunatic.  
Bjorn:  
Oh, so you have family in Solstheim.  
Ulain:  
Just Falas. He had some disagreements with the boss. He has this habit of taking things that don’t belong tohim.  
Bjorn:  
The boss? Who’s that?  
Ulain:  
A brute with a lot of power and sharp fangs who’s going to rip me to shreds if I don’t get back soon.

**Dialogue with Player**

Player:  
Well, here we are\!  
Ulain:  
Here, try this Sujamma. We can leave in a bit if you want. Just needed to clear my head.  
Player:  
Alright... Can we talk for a bit?  
Ulain:  
Depends, what do you want to talk about?

**Responses:**

Player:  
What do you know about the girl?  
Ulain:  
Ah, the mysterious shadow. She's like a bad dream you can't wake up from. But dreams don't tell you much, do they? She attacked the last three shipments. I wasn't there the other times, but now I wanted to see it with my own eyes.

Player:  
Tell me about this "Boss" of yours.  
Ulain:  
The Boss? Just a puppet master pulling strings. And me? I'm just one of the marionettes. Not much else to say, is there?

Player:  
What's in the shipments?  
Ulain:  
Something very valuable... Worth its weight in blood, you could say. It's the kind of treasure that makes men willing to kill and die for it. But honestly, I think that's none of your business.

Player:  
Where are we headed next?  
Ulain:  
A cozy little place, really. Full of charm and... ebony. Yes, an ebony mine. You’ll love it. I'll mark it on your map. We can head there whenever you're ready.

**Conversation between Ulain and the Guard at the entrance to Ebondraw Mine**

Guard: Hello sir, how have you been?  
Ulain: Well enough... Everything alright here? Anything I should know about?  
Guard: Yes, no news here…  
Ulain: Alright, stay alert. I'm going to take a look around.  
Guard: Wait, who are these?  
Ulain: Hired mercenaries, don't worry, they're with me.  
Guard: They look familiar... Alright, if you say so, go ahead.

**Inside the Ebondraw Mine:**

Ulain: Let's see how these idiots are doing...  
Guard 1: Ulain... I thought you weren't coming back. How's that wretch of a brother of yours?  
Ulain: From what I know, he's busy selling his trinkets.  
Guard 2: I heard something’s been killing the haulers like flies. You scared? You brought company...  
Guard 1: What a strange choice of mercenaries...  
Guard 3: Stop being an idiot. This damn Dunmer fears nothing.  
Guard 1: Hey, Ulain, got a question... Last batch of miners had a boy among them. Check the big cell, he can't handle the pickaxe. Should we get rid of him?  
Ulain: Of course not. Give him a crust of bread now and then and a lighter tool. If he doesn't die soon, he’ll still be useful... work will keep him warm, it's cold here.  
Guard 2: Yeah... the other day it was so cold I thought eating your horse might be a good idea... why do you leave it here?  
Ulain: Touch my horse and you'll be the next one on the menu. I leave him here because he likes to stay out of trouble, unlike some

Bjorn: You heartless bastards... you'll pay for this\!

**Chaos erupts in the mine\!\!\!**

Bjorn: We have to get them out of here. One of these damned bastards has to have the key\!

Bjorn Scene:  
"Where's that cursed Dunmer? Must have fled like a coward."  
“Forgive me, I couldn't help it. This caught me off guard… you know.”  
“I should've known, but seeing that kid... made me want to kill every last one of them. Let's see how he's doing.”

**Convo with Lorzub**

Lorzub: Oh, it's you, Blood-Kin... I must say I'm not surprised.  
Player: Are you alright?  
Lorzub: Do I look alright to you? It would be better if he killed me… But my son prefers to see me like this. This is what I get for helping your friend.  
Player: What? What do you mean, your son?  
Lorzub: Yes, he prefers to see me suffering... Thank you for freeing me, friend. I owe you now and want to show you a few things.  
Take me back to Nordholm, you will understand everything.  
There's a little boy in the other cell. I've heard him crying every night... Maybe you could help him.

\====================================================================

### **Act \#5 \- Innocence Taken**

Barni: "Please, don't leave me here alone."  
Player: "Where are your parents?"  
Barni: "I... I don't know who they are... please don't leave me here."  
Player: "Alright... what's your name?"  
Barni: It's Barni... I was in a place like this, but... now I'm here... Can you take me back there?  
Player: Back there? Oh, come on, let's find a safe place and we'll talk.  
Barni: Alright…

#### **Talk to Barni in a safe place**   **Bjorn:** Hey Barni, my mother used to call me Barni too, as a nickname. Are you sure that’s your name?

**Barni:** She never called me that. She died when I was born... but a guard used to call me that.

**Lorzub:** I know your story, Barni. You were in another mine with me. Let me mark it on your map, Blood-Kin.

**Player:** Tell me more about this place.

**Lorzub:** I knew the people there. They said his mother got pregnant inside the mine and died during childbirth. They believed your father was one of the bandits guarding the place because he protected the boy all these years… This bandit guarded the mine’s entrance, a big red-haired Nord. Did you see him?

**Player:** Yes\! He was the guard at the door, but why didn’t he say anything?

**Lorzub:** Guards are forbidden from forming relationships with the slaves; Groshak himself forbade it under penalty of death. Pregnant and sorrowful women work less. That's the only reason, I suppose.

**Bjorn:** We can't leave him with a bandit to live in a mine\!

**Lorzub:** Yes, Bjorn, I believe that's not a possibility.

**Bjorn:** In any case, that bandit disappeared along with Ulain. Ulain must have taken him to protect himself.

Speak with Bjorn.

**Bjorn:** So, can we take the boy with us?

**Player:** He’s not a pet, Bjorn...

**Bjorn:** I know, but we need to help him. Taking care of a child isn’t exactly easy, but I feel like this is a second chance for me to do what I couldn’t for my sister. It would be good for me, you know, to take care of him. But I’m not sure we can protect him.

**Player:** We can teach him to defend himself\!

**Bjorn:** Barni never seen the world, it would be a great adventure, wouldn’t it? 

What do you say, Barni? Want to come with us and see Skyrim?

**Barni:** Oh yes, I really want to\! Don’t worry, I know how to run and hide.

**Bjorn:** 

**Bjorn’s old house basement**

Lorzub: "There’s a place I need you to go, Blood-Kin, but first, let me tell you who I am. Sit down... I am the uncle of Chief Mauhulakh... and the father of Groshak."

Player: "You’re Groshak’s father? You must be joking."

Lorzub: "I wish I were... I had two sons, Groshak and Thurak. We lived in the Stronghold, both working in the mines. Mauhulakh, young and full of ambition, fell for a girl... Uglarz, also a miner. Groshak was fond of her too, but Mauhulakh was destined to inherit the stronghold after defeating my brother. Groshak always had a dark streak... He felt overshadowed, and one day, he went hunting with Uglarz, and she never returned... Sometime later, a baby was left in the frozen courtyard, with a note saying, 'Take care of your grandson, I cannot return, his name is Thruzar. \- Uglarz.'"

Player: "Groshak is Thruzar’s father? Does he know this?"

Lorzub: "No, he doesn’t know... Groshak’s darkness runs deep, and his shadow touches everyone around him. But Thruzar... he has a good heart. I don’t want him to carry that burden, please don’t tell him."

Lorzub: "I confronted Groshak about this, and he attacked me. I had to banish him, and he fled to Cragwallow Slope, staying there for years. Shortly after, Thurak disappeared too. I need you to go there and find out what happened to my other son."

Player: "Why should I help you? And why do you live here instead of the Stronghold?"

Lorzub: "Groshak returned one day, claiming to have a solution for Mauhulakh’s problems and the shortage of orcs in the mines. I don’t know if the chief was afraid or found it convenient. I watched all this unfold, feeling helpless. I’m ashamed to say, I was a coward. I dug a tunnel, through which Adielle escaped to the village. Thruzar left torches at the exit, and I took the blame. Mauhulakh expelled me from the stronghold."

Player: "I’ll go to this necromancer’s den. I want to see what’s there."

Lorzub: "Yes, please, Blood-Kin. I hope you can forgive me. It’s located here. Find my son... the good son. You can leave Barni here while you search; I’ll take good care of him."

### **Act \#6 \- Bloodline’s Secrets**

##### **Diary of Groshak**

20th of Frostfall

Another cursed day in this wretched mine... This isn't the life for me. Uglarz and my brother have given up, but not me. I'm meant for greater things. Mauhulakh, sitting on his imaginary throne, watches us toil with that smug look. That lazy fool.

25th of Frostfall

Finally, some luck\! While digging, I found a tunnel carved from the other side\! I followed it to a hidden chamber... a necromancer’s den in a nearby cave. An old forge stood there, surrounded by robed figures. I stayed hidden, watching them. They were obsessed with one book. Tonight, I’ll steal it and learn their secrets.

1st of Sun's Dusk

Got the book. It’s called "Ritual of Domination." Spent all night reading it. Their plans are dark, they want our ebony for an altar to Molag Bal. I see a way to use this to my advantage. 

10th of Sun's Dusk

Revealed myself to the necromancers today. They were ready to kill me, but I mentioned the book and my offer to help. They plan to enslave the orcs, force us to mine. I convinced them I could find another way. Mauhulakh thinks he’s the protector, but it’s me who will save us.

20th of Sun's Dusk

Came up with a plan\! I’ll smuggle our ebony to the forge, make weapons, and get the bandits to help. Skyrim is crawling with them. Trade weapons for their help in capturing people, turning them into laborers in the mines. There's a Nord village nearby I hate... I'll take them and put the bandits in charge.

1st of Evening Star

Having trouble forging the weapons. Need Uglarz’s skill. She stirs something in me I can’t understand. She’s meant for Mauhulakh, but why should he have everything? I’ll show her the forge, explain my plan. She needs to see my strength.

15th of Evening Star

Thurak... always happy, always curious. Caught him near the tunnel entrance today. He gets suspicious when he stops hearing my pickaxe, but he never finds me. Need to be careful. He could ruin everything.

1st of Morning Star

Showed the forge to Uglarz. Her fear was real when I spoke of the necromancers’ plans. She doesn’t get it yet. She defied me, said she’d never be mine. Anger burned inside me. Locked her in the chamber’s cage. Her fear fuels me.

10th of Morning Star

Allied with bandits to attack Nordholm. My studies with the necromancers are progressing. Once the altar is done, I’ll have the power to dominate not just Uglarz, but anyone. Need a heart for the Ritual... maybe Thurak’s.

1st of Rain's Hand

Thurak found the passage and freed Uglarz. They ran off together. Curse him\! But I still have the altar. I’ll raise an army of shadows. Pay the bandits to find them and bring them back. Hard to dig the mine without Thurak...

1st of Second Seed

News came that Thurak and Uglarz were captured by my bounty. They brought back Thurak, left Uglarz and the child. That boy should have been mine... Thurak will pay.

10th of Second Seed

Uglarz left the child with my father, a note says his name is Thruzar. She must be afraid I’ll find her. I feel her desperation. She deserves it... Did it thinking I wouldn’t hurt him. She’s right. Leaving the Stronghold, had a fight with my father. Won’t watch that boy grow up, it fills me with rage.  I closed the passage that led to the forge. Moving to the den, need focus.

10th of Rain's Hand

Mauhulakh is alone. Father tries to protect him, but without allies, he’s weak. He agreed to turn Nordholm into a bandit haven. A coward, not the leader everyone thinks. I am the true power here.

25th of Rain's Hand

Invasion of Nordholm wasn’t easy. There was a healer, fought hard but died. Some died, a boy escaped. A girl stayed with the bandits. Don’t need her in the mine, but I’m not a monster. Can’t kill her.

30th of Second Seed

Father dug a tunnel in the mine, slaves escaped, set fire to the village\! He’ll pay, not with death, but I’ll think of something. Doesn’t matter anymore, the altar is ready.

15th of Midyear

Time to see its power. Communing with a Daedric lord\! My excitement is overwhelming. Finally, it’s all worth it. First victim for the altar, my own brother, proof of my strength to Molag Bal.

1st of Sun's Height

Exhilarating. Thurak’s heart throbbed in my hands as I recited the ritual. He’s mine now, a monstrosity under my command\! Leaving him to guard the altar. Need more. Expanding beyond Skyrim. One day, I’ll conquer cities with my army, become the dominator of Nirn. Molag Bal and I, bound by power.

\===================================================================

##### **The Book**  **"Ritual of Domination" por Morian Zenas**

It is a rare and perilous venture to delve into the machinations of the Daedric Princes, particularly those as malevolent as Molag Bal. Known as the Lord of Domination, Molag Bal's influence reaches far and wide, ensnaring the souls of the unwary and the power-hungry alike. In the annals of Daedric lore, one ritual stands out for its sheer audacity and dark grandeur: the Ritual of Domination.

The origins of this ritual can be traced back to a hidden sect of necromancers, fervent devotees of Molag Bal, who sought to harness the latent power of ebony, that dark and forbidding mineral, to construct an altar worthy of their dread lord. The ritual itself is as intricate as it is malevolent, requiring the utmost precision and an unwavering will.

The ritual begins with the acquisition of ebony ingots, forged with meticulous care. According to ancient texts, the ebony must be mined by those in a state of servitude and despair, their suffering imbuing the mineral with the necessary potency. It is said that the ingots should number in the hundreds, each one a testament to the toils and tribulations of the enslaved.

Once the ingots are amassed, the next step involves the construction of the altar. This task is not merely physical but also spiritual, for the altar must be a conduit to the realm of Molag Bal. The instructions for its construction are found in an obscure grimoire, a tome bound in the skin of a Daedroth, inked with the blood of innocents. The altar, once completed, stands as a beacon of dark power, its surfaces inscribed with runes of summoning and binding.

The final component of the ritual is perhaps the most harrowing: the sacrifice. A heart must be taken from a living being, one whose essence is steeped in fear and agony. This heart is to be placed upon the altar, where a chant is intoned to invoke the presence of Molag Bal. The chant, as recorded in the grimoire, is as follows:

"Oh, Molag Bal, Lord of Domination,  
Accept this offering, my devotion.  
With ebony forged, blood and soul,  
I invoke your power, your presence that controls.  
Come to us, Prince of Darkness,  
And bless this altar with your dominion."

The incantation, once spoken, resonates through the very fabric of Oblivion, summoning Molag Bal to the altar. It is at this moment that the ritualist must bind their will to that of the Daedric Prince, for any wavering can result in their immediate and gruesome demise.

It is of utmost importance to note that those who seek to perform this ritual do so at great personal peril. Molag Bal is not a benevolent patron, and his gifts are often laced with curses that ensnare the soul for eternity. The Ritual of Domination is not merely a means to power; it is a pact with darkness, a surrender to the will of the Daedric Prince whose very name inspires dread.

In my studies, I have encountered numerous accounts of those who have attempted this ritual, their fates often too horrific to recount in detail. Suffice it to say, the path to power through Molag Bal is fraught with peril and assuredly not for the faint of heart.

\================================================================

##### **After the player read the diary**

Player:  
Bjorn, look, it’s Groshak’s diary.

Bjorn:  
Oh, this is horrible… It's a story much darker than Lorzub told us, you see; Groshak's madness is worse than I thought.   
This isn't just about finding my sister anymore, you know. He’s ruining countless lives with the help of a Daedric demon, he’s got their favor, and we need to stop him.

Player: Let's look for this forge. Thurak is there.  
Bjorn: Yes, let’s find the forge... There may still be hope to undo what Groshak did to him…

##### **The player was taken to the Frost Shade mine**

##### 

Slave:  
"Hey, you. You're finally awake."  
Player:  
"I think I’ve heard that before. Where is this place?"  
Slave:  
"They brought you here unconscious, not even a day ago. Are you a warrior? I saw you came with weapons. We’ve never had anyone like you here."  
Player:  
"Sort of. How can I get out of here?"  
Slave:  
"There are a lot of guards outside. I don’t know why they don’t do the work themselves; they’re always in large numbers, those scoundrels. They prefer to ruin our lives instead."  
Player:  
"Did anyone else come with me?"  
Slave:  
"No, I’m sorry, it was just you."

#####      **Little Shadow comes to the rescue**

Little Shadow:  
"Finally, I found you. You look terrible. Come on, we need to move. 

Player: Why am I in this mine? How did I get here?

Little Shadow:  
“I’m not sure why they brought you here, but it seems they had orders not to kill you... someone must be coming for you. Ha, they’ll be in for a nasty surprise, won’t they? Your things should be around here somewhere."

Player: Why did you come to save me?  
Little Shadow:  
I need your help. There's a place we must go, and I need you to 'take care' of someone there... however you think is best.

Player: Have you been following me?  
Little Shadow:  
Always. I learned to walk in the shadows to get what I want.

\=====================================================================

**Outside Frostshade Mine**

**Menu: May I know what you are thinking?**  
I know you're worried about Bjorn... and, believe it or not, so am I. You'll find him—probably alive. That’s why I brought you here. But we don’t have time to linger, so let’s get moving.

**Dialogue:**  
Player: What is this place we're heading to?  
Little Shadow:  
You sure ask a lot of questions, don’t you? Relax, if I wanted you dead, I wouldn’t have bothered saving you, right? And let’s be honest, I don’t think you’re really worried about that. But hey, you don’t need to understand everything just yet. You’ll see it for yourself soon enough.

**Arriving at the hidden shack**

Little Shadow:  
Go ahead, here's the key…

**Inside the Shack**

**Scene**

Little Shadow to player:  
Don't be alarmed... scenes like this are more common than you'd think.

Little Shadow to Ulain:  
So, you really thought they were just simple mercenaries. You're even dumber than you look.

Ulain to Player:  
Oh, I knew you were involved in this, you bastard.

Ulain to Little Shadow:  
If you kill me without finding Groshak, you'll never locate him.

Roggvar:  
Please, let me go... I have a son, I need to find him.

Little Shadow to Ulain:  
You've already told me what I wanted to know, coward. Our friend here will get the rest out of you, however they please. As for your guard dog over there, well, he's useless.

Roggvar:  
Wait, I can help... I've been to all those places…

Ulain to Roggvar:  
Oh, shut up, you idiot.

**Dialogue with player**

Little Shadow:  
I’m leaving them now. Do what you will, but remember, he’s the key to finding my brother. I know he’s important to you.

Player:  
Your brother? You knew it was him all along, didn't you?

Little Shadow:  
Yes, and I intended for him to never know. Honestly, before you showed up, I had no respect for him and thought he'd never want a sister like me. But you changed him. I don't know what you did, but he's different now.  
Player:  
Do you forgive him for leaving you with the bandits?

Little Shadow:  
I never blamed him. I understand the weight he carries, but I can't ease that burden. I'm no better than he is. The day I burned the village and killed the only person I remember who loved me, the woman I called mother, I stopped being Adielle. My only purpose now is to destroy Groshak. Nothing else matters. I don't need his help or yours for that.

Player:  
Where is Groshak?

Little Shadow: In Solstheim. These fools told me, and while I don't trust them, I know the name of the mine where all the orders come from. Here, take this note. I got it from another mine while I was searching for you. This stupid Dunmer knows where Bjorn is, I'm sure of it. 

**Ulain Note**

I will be arriving in Windhelm in the coming days and need your ebony. Send it to the nearby camp. I understand you're short on people, so this time I'll visit only Ebondrawn and Nightstone to assess the quality of the "good souls" I’ll be bringing. I expect the same from you next time.

Player:  
And what am I here for?

Little Shadow:  
Get it out of him however you see fit. I'll send you a letter from Solstheim once I'm certain of the mine's location. But by the time it reaches you, it will be too late. I'm leaving now. Please, save my brother quickly. Those bastards know how to be cruel.

**Hello**

Ulain:  
Come on, the place where Bjorn is being held is huge. Trust me, you'll need my help.  
Did you change your mind?

Roggvar:  
Please, take me with you. I can help you find your friend... Maybe my son is there too.

**(Player frees both, for now)**

**Dialogues**

Player: Alright, I'll take you with me. Tell me where he is. (Free Ulain)  
Ulain: Excellent, I knew you'd see reason\! Let me show you where it is on your map.

Player: Your son, Barni, is with me.  
Ulain: You have Barni? I can't believe it\! Where is he? Is he safe?  
Player: Yes, he's better off without you.  
Ulain: I understand. Let me prove my worth to you. I'll help you find your friend and make up for my past mistakes.  
**or**  
Player: Yes, he's safe. Don't worry.  
Roggvar: I'm relieved to hear that. Even if I don't make it out of this alive, I know he's in good hands. 

Can you get my armor from that chest? You've got the key. They'll be suspicious if I show up in these rags.

**Outside the shack**

Ulain:  
Alright, here's the plan. Don't be impulsive this time, got it? Listen and pay attention.  
Groshak's scheme is more twisted than you can imagine, and it only gets worse. I've been wanting out of this for a while, to get back to my life.

Player:  
I already know it's very twisted.

Ulain:  
Hm, you don't even know half of it. That girl is in great danger, not that I care. Rescue Bjorn and go after her, if it's not too late.

Player:  
Why should I trust you?

Ulain:  
Not even these brutish bandits know the full extent, but I do. I'm in this up to my neck.  
Believe me, I'm not all bad. I was trying to protect Barni too…

Roggvar to Ulain:  
You knew about Barni? Why didn't you ever help me?

Ulain to Roggvar:  
I saw them gouge your eye out when they caught you with that girl. Do you really think I'm stupid? Stay close to the cells, talk to Bjorn, and keep him from doing anything reckless.

**Nightstone Mine**

Ulain:  
Strange, no guards at the door. Let's go in and find out what's going on.

Player: Wait, this isn't a trap, is it?

Ulain: Of course not. Even if it were, I know you can handle it. A few bandits wouldn't stand a chance against you.

Player: But what about Molag Bal?

Ulain: Hm, you saw that monster, didn't you? Come on, stop with that. Fear doesn't suit you. I promise, there's nothing like that here \- just the usual dumb bandits and forced labor.

**Inside the Mine**

Ulain:  
See, just another filthy mine. Let's find that cat, Nanoud is in charge here. Keep it together, okay?

Nanoud:  
Ulain, you brought Roggvar... Good, we need more men. We've had some trouble lately, I'll fill you in on the details. Oh... and who might this be?

Ulain:  
My personal guard, because of the attacks on the ships, you know.

Nanoud:  
Yes, Nanoud knows. Nanoud also hears that the necromancers in Cragwallow had intruders. They were split between the mines. One of them ended up here, a fierce Nord with war paint, seems to be a mercenary. We left him out of the cell, and he woke up and killed two guards with a pickaxe.

Ulain:  
You milk-drinkers really can't handle anything, can you? Leave it to me, I have a solution. I'll take a look at them and get back to you.

**Nearby the cell**

Ulain:  
Well, we have plenty of them this time. It's more than enough. The ship arrives in two days.

Nanoud:  
Nanoud does not understand. Why don't those necromancers do what needs to be done here? Transporting lifeless bodies would be much easier.

Ulain:  
It's not that simple. Groshak himself needs to perform the rituals. He has some kind of dark Daedric pact...Something you really don't want to know about... Here's the plan: I'll leave these men here to assist you. I need to return to Windhelm to prepare. Take good care of them, and I'll see you all another time.

Nanoud:  
Hm, that might work. Roggvar, take these loaves of bread to those wretches inside. They haven't eaten since yesterday... Here's the key.

Roggvar:  
Yes, I'll handle it.

Nanoud to Player:  
And you, my friend, stay inside and don't cause any trouble, yes? And try to keep your temper in check. I can see that look of disgust on your face.

**Now Bjorn attacks and kills Roggvar with the pickaxe,**   
**the player helps him to kill all bandits**

Player:  
So, how have you enjoyed your stay?

Bjorn: Hahaha\! Quite the adventure, I must say\!

Player: Come on, we need to get out of here.

Bjorn: Agreed. Thank you, truly, my friend. You've saved my life. I owe you more than I can ever repay.

Player: You don't owe me anything. We're in this together\!

Bjorn: That means a lot, you know? Hey, before we go, there's one thing I'd like to ask of you. I know you've already done so much for me, but... could you teach me some magic? Maybe I could've defended myself better. You know, I should be the one protecting you…

Player:   
1 \- Bjorn, you don't need to defend the Dragonborn\!  
2 \- I think you've done enough damage with that pickaxe.  
3 \- Of course, once we have some time, I'll show you a few tricks.

Bjorn:   
1 \- Ha, I guess you're right. But it wouldn't hurt to be able to help a bit more. Just in case…  
2 \- Fair point. But a little extra firepower wouldn't hurt, right?  
3 \- Oh, I'm eager to learn\! Maybe next time, I can be the one saving you\!

Player:  
Where are the things that were with you?

Bjorn:  
Hmm... I'm not sure, but I bet the Khajiit has the key. He's the only one who's been in here besides that dumb bandit.

Player: You know the bandit who came in was Barni's father, right?

Bjorn: I do, and it doesn't change a thing. He was a damn coward and didn't deserve to be called a father, or even to exist in the realm of Nirn.

Player:Yes, I know. But maybe everyone deserves a chance to change.

Bjorn: Well, interesting that you'd defend him. I'm curious to know what he did to earn your trust.

Player:Alright, we'll talk about it later.

Bjorn: Right, sorry if I seemed uncomfortable. It's just... he's a bandit, you know.

Player: I've been with your sister... Little Shadow.

Bjorn: What? Little Shadow is really my sister? I... I knew it\! Where is she? Why did she hide this from me? Oh, I have so many questions.

Player: She's gone after Groshak in Solstheim.

Bjorn: Solstheim? Did she say where? We have to go after her\! She could be in danger, I can't lose her again.

Player: I'm afraid not. She said she'd send a letter when she gets there.

Bjorn: I hope she sends it soon... I don't know anything about that place. Tell me more about her\! Where did you find her?

Player: We have a lot to talk about. Let's get out of here, Bjorn.

Bjorn: You're right, Let's get out of here and talk more once we're safe... It's great to be with you again, you know? I thought I'd die in this place.

\=====================================================================

### Act \#7 \- Cold Dread

**Do you feel like talking?**

Bjorn: Yeah, sure. Let’s talk about what happened after we walked into that forge and saw that... thing.

Player: It was pretty shocking to see what had become of Thurak, wasn’t it?

Bjorn: Shocking is one way to put it. Makes you wonder if there’s any part of Thurak still in there.

Player: Do you think there’s a chance he’s aware of what’s happening to him?

Bjorn:  I hope not. If he’s trapped in that... state, it’s worse than death. Poor Thruzar... And what’s worse? Lorzub thinks he was the son of a monster, but the truth is, he’s the son of another. Both heartless, sure, but the second one... he’s more of a victim, isn’t he? Maybe we should head to that tower and talk to him.

\=====================================================================

**Arriving at the Watchtower in Riften**

Shagra: Blood-Kin, I’m sorry... I messed up. I took advantage of a moment when Thruzy was distracted and went back to that awful place to get more Skooma... I don’t know what I was thinking. When I came back, Thruzar was gone. I found this letter he wrote to you. I guess he thought I wasn’t coming back... I’ve been on my own ever since. I want to convince him to come back here... He's gone to the Stronghold. Mind if I tag along? I should probably check on old Lorzub, see how he's doing. I need his wise counsel.

Player: Alright, you can come with me.  
Shagra: Thanks, Blood-Kin. Let’s go.

**Menu Follower Shagra**

Let's trade some things.

* Sure, let's trade.

Goodbye

* Alright, then.

Hello

* What do you need?

**Thruzar left but left a note and Shagra came back and found it**

Blood-Kin,

*Shagra’s gone... again. Always knew that damned Skooma meant more to her than I ever could. Hurts worse every time. The addiction controls her, I guess. I’m heading back to the Stronghold. Maybe if I bury myself in work, it’ll stop the ache. Hope you find this note.*

*—Thruzar*

**Arriving at Bjorn's basement**

**Scene 01**

Barni: Oh, you’re back\!

Shagra: Well, aren’t you a cute lad. Where did you come from?

Bjorn: Good to see you’re being well looked after, Barni. But where’s Lorzub?

**Barni to Player**

Barni: He heard some scary sounds from the Stronghold. He said he was going to check it out, but he told me to stay here. I’ve been waiting, but... I’m kinda scared. Do you think he’s okay?

Player: Stay here with Shagra for a bit, okay? She's nice, trust me.

Barni: But... is it dangerous? Will you be long? Can I come with you? What's happening?

Player: I really need to go now, but don’t worry \- We'll be right back.

**Scene 02**

Shagra: Hey, don’t worry, little one. I’ll stay with you, and we can have some fun while they’re gone. Maybe we’ll even play a game, huh? How does that sound?

Barni: Alright then... Hey, Shagra, how did your teeth get so big?... Do they hurt when you chew? Can you bite through anything?

Shagra: By Malacath

Bjorn: Hahaha, time to go.

**Outside the Basement**

**Bjorn ForceGreet**

Wait... I know it’s urgent, but before we go, could you teach me that healing spell? I don’t need to mess with fire magic right now. I’d rather stick to what I know best: fighting with my sword. With the challenge ahead... being able to heal myself might make a real difference.

Player: Alright, I’ll show you. Pay attention—it won’t take long.

Bjorn: Alright then, let’s do this\!  
Bjorn: Thanks, you always know how to come through when it matters. I won’t forget this.

**Fight at Narzulbur**

Thruzar’s Combat Lines

Come on, you monster\! I'll cut you down\!  
I've faced worse than you, beast\!  
You won't take us that easily\!  
I've seen darker days than this\!  
I won't let this beast take my Stronghold\!  
This ends here, monster\!

Bjorn’s Combat Lines

Keep fighting, Thruzar\! We're not done yet\!  
Stay strong, Thruzar, he's weakening\!

**Talk to Thruzar**

Thruzar: It’s not over yet, Blood-Kin\! The mine is crawling with necromancers. I bet they were counting on that cursed beast to take us out before they invaded the Stronghold.

Player: About that beast, there are some things I need to tell you.  
Thruzar: We don’t have time for that right now. Whatever they’re up to, it’s happening fast. I’ve been on guard for days, and no one got past me, yet they keep appearing inside the mine. I don’t know how they’re doing it, but one thing’s certain—they’ll pay for every life they’ve taken here.

or

Player: Let’s go—we don’t have time to waste.  
Thruzar: We'll make them pay for every death they've caused here.

**After killing the necromancers, in the forge**

Thruzar: For Malacath's wrath\! What is this cursed place? Has this been hidden inside our mine all this time, and we never knew?

Bjorn: Actually, Thruzar, this place lies within Cragwallow Slope... Groshak found a way inside and struck a deal with the necromancers… He bartered the ebony he extracted for their forbidden knowledge... leading to the creation of this altar to Molag Bal."

Thruzar: "Hold on, Bjorn... What are you talking about? Groshak did this? This... altar? That can't be true, Blood-Kin, you need to make sense of this\!"

Bjorn: "It's the truth. That's why Groshak paid those bandits to attack my village. It's why my mother was killed and my sister taken. All of it, just to build this cursed forge, a tool to enslave souls and bend wills. And he... he didn't stop there."

Thruzar: "And... that creature we fought... What in Oblivion was that? Blood-Kin, Bjorn, someone explain this to me\! My head is spinning."

Player: Groshak did all this, and I want to talk to you about that creature.  
Thruzar:  He did this to him? Who was this poor soul?

Option 1 \- "Thruzar, I know this is hard to hear, but... it was your father. Thurak."

Thruzar: But... who was Thurak? Lorzub always told me he found me in the snow, but he never said anything about my father…

Lorzub... my old man... he's gone now. Blood-Kin... I... I need time to make sense of this. Thank you for telling me the truth.

Option 2 \- "That creature was a servant of Molag Bal, twisted by the necromancers' magic.

Thruzar This is a lot to take in... I... I need time to make sense of this. We should head back to the Stronghold.

Player: 

Thruzar: Shagra? Well, at least there’s some good news amidst all this chaos... Let’s get out of here.

Basement Scene

Shagra: Thruzar...\! You’re alive\! I was so afraid that…

Thruzar: It’s good to see you too, Shagra. But... not everyone was so fortunate. The Stronghold... Lorzub is gone, and so many others with him. I... I'm sorry.

Shagra: No... Lorzub... He was like a father to me too... But at least you made it, Thruzy. And all of you, whatever you faced up there, it sounds like it was a real challenge.

Barni: Was it a dragon? Or a giant? Can I go see?

Bjorn: No, lad, it's no place for you. Trust me, it's nothing you need to see… 

Thruzar: "I wish things had turned out differently... but we can’t change what’s done. For now, Shagra, it’s best if the Blood-Kin takes Barni away from here. He shouldn’t see this place like this... and neither should we. Come back in a few days. I need some time to process everything and figure out what comes next."

Player: "Understood, Thruzar. Take care of yourself, and we’ll take care of Barni."

Thruzar: "Thank you, Blood-Kin. You’ll always have a place by my side when all this is over."

\======================================================================

### 

Courier:  
A letter from a girl, a little rough around the edges. I actually considered throwing it out... sorry about that.

**First Little Shadow’s Letter**

Player,

So, I've made it to Solstheim. No sign of Groshak, just a camp of fools too dumb to realize how close they were to death. What was Ulain thinking? He's delusional. I'll be seeing him again, unless, of course, you've already finished him off.

I did come across something, though. A bounty. Seems like someone wants you and Bjorn out of the way. Funny how they thought that would work.

And... thank you for saving my brother. I know he's alive. Let’s just say I have eyes all over Skyrim. You've done more than you know.

Stay sharp, I'll find that wretch, and I’ll be in touch soon.

\-- Little Shadow

\===================================================================

### Act \#8 \- Soul Chains

**Player receives the letter**

Player: "Look, Bjorn, it’s a letter from your sister\!"  
Bjorn: "Really? Oh, it’s good to know she’s alright. What does it say?"

Player Options:  
1- "She couldn’t find the place; Ulain tricked her."  
Bjorn: Ha, figures. Ulain’s about as trustworthy as a skeever in a pantry. I’d almost feel sorry for him... if he wasn’t such a pain.

2- "There’s a bounty out for our heads."  
Bjorn: A bounty? Heh, well, that’s one way to feel important. Seems like we’re making quite the impression, huh?

3- "She knows and is happy that you’re alive."  
Bjorn: That's... good to hear. It’s nice to know she cares... I never really thought she would, well... you know, keep track of me like this.

4- "She’ll send another letter soon."  
Yeah, I wish I could do more... but let’s be honest, we probably wouldn’t have found her even if we tried. She’s sharp, that one. I bet she’ll sniff him out soon enough. We’ve seen what she can do, haven’t we?

**Kill Order**

You filthy lot,

Consider yourselves lucky. You get to keep that fancy weapon I gave you, and don't worry, there's more where that came from. Your target is our well-known and annoying 'hero' and their oversized friend. 

Get it done, or don't bother coming back.

\- Groshak

\===================================================================

**After killing Rathis**

Bjorn:  
"Well, looks like Little Shadow wasn’t joking... Makes you wonder how many more he’s sent after us. I’m sorry, I never meant for my problems to drag you into this mess. I should be protecting you, not the other way around."

Player:  
1 \- "Don’t worry, we’re in this together."  
2 \- "True, you do cause me a lot of problems."

Bjorn:  
”Ha, I know... but you’re not exactly easy to look after either, you know? Did you notice his sword? It’s far better than the usual ones."

Player:  
1 \- "Yeah, I hope they all carry gear like this."  
2 \- "Yeah, makes it easier for them to kill us with it."

Bjorn:  
1 \- "Well, then let’s hope they keep gifting us. Makes our job easier."  
2 \- "Easier to kill us, sure... but then again, I’ve survived worse than idiots with shiny toys."

\======================================================================

**Bjorn has gone and left you a note**

**Bjorn’s Note**

Got a letter from Ulain. Meet me at the New Gnisis Cornerclub—I’ve got a plan.

— *Bjorn*

*\==================================================================*

**Bjorn and Ulain Scene**

Bjorn: "It’ll be easy. I’ve got her full trust—she won’t even see it coming."

Ulain: "Excellent. Kill her with this weapon and trap her soul in this stone. Once you’ve done that, you can trade it for your sister."

Bjorn: "If that’s the only way... Who knows, maybe I could even become one of Groshak’s top men if the pay’s right. Fine, where do I take the stone?"

Ulain: "Here, I’ll mark it on your map. Go alone, Groshak will be waiting for you."

Bjorn: “Ha, alright, enough of this farce. You messed with the wrong Nord, slimy fetcher.”

**Dialogue with Bjorn**

Player:  
"You told Ulain you were going to kill me?\!"

Bjorn:  
"Yes... I had to. Did you believe it?"

Player:  
1 \- "Not for a second."  
2 \- "Actually, I did..."

Bjorn (1):  
"Ha, good. I’d never do that to you. You know that by now, right? As you must know, I’d follow you to the depths of Oblivion if I had to."

Bjorn (2):  
"I understand... It must’ve seemed real. But I could never. As you must know, I’d follow you to the depths of Oblivion if it meant keeping you safe."

Bjorn:  
"Here, I need to show you something. I received a letter from Groshak. I want you to read it."

\===================================================================

**Letter from Groshak**

Bjorn,

Your meddling sister is dead. Sad? Don’t be—at least not yet. It can be undone. My lord Molag Bal can bring her back, but it’s going to cost you. And I’m sure you know what I want.

Your friend has a very special soul, one I desire greatly. Here’s the deal: bring me a filled soul gem with their soul inside, and I’ll give you what you want in return.

— Groshak

\==================================================================

**Player reads the letter**

Player:  
"Is it true? Little Shadow... Adielle, is she really dead?\!"

Bjorn:  
"I... I don’t know. Maybe. It sounds like it, but we have to go there and see for ourselves. If it’s true... maybe there’s a way to bring her back."

Player:  
1 \- "Through some Daedric ritual? How would that even work?"  
2 \- "I think it’s better to leave things as they are."

Bjorn (1):  
"I don’t know yet, but Groshak knows how to speak to Molag Bal. If he can do it, maybe I can too. We’ll confront him, learn the ritual, kill him, and then... maybe I can bring my sister back."  
Bjorn (2):  
"Whether we like it or not, Groshak is waiting for me, and now I know where he is. I can’t let this go—I have to try and save her. If you won’t help me, I’ll go alone. I thought you’d understand."

*(Bjorn walks away if the player chooses not to help)*

---

Player:  
1 \- "It’s risky, but if there’s a chance, we have to take it."  
2 \- "I still think it’s better to leave things as they are."

Bjorn (1):  
"Thank you. I knew I could count on you. We’ll go in, take down Groshak and his lot, whether Adielle is alive or not. Groshak deserves to die for what he’s done."  
Bjorn (2):  
"If you won’t come with me, I’ll go alone. She needs me. I thought you of all people would understand."

*(Bjorn walks away)*

\==================================================================

**Groshak’s Scene**

Groshak: "Ah, you brought them alive... No matter. We can settle this right here."

Groshak (to player):

"Your soul... the most powerful in all of Tamriel, maybe even all of Nirn. And now, you’ve delivered it to me, just as Molag Bal foresaw. This was always your fate."

Bjorn:

"That’ll never happen, you bastard... Enough of your stupid games. Now, what did you do to my sister?\!"

Groshak(to Bjorn):

"Your sister? She’s right there, Bjorn. But she’s not much for conversation these days... Looks a bit dead, doesn’t she?"

Bjorn:

"You're going to pay for this. I'll make sure of it."

Groshak:

"Pay? You think you've won something? Let me enlighten you. They're all dead, Bjorn. Every last one of them."

"I take their souls, bind them to weapons, and they serve me... forever. Just like your precious sister will."

Groshak (to Adielle):

"Look at her. She's mine now, just a hollow shell under my control. The brave warrior reduced to my puppet."

Groshak (to player):

"I have something special, a weapon like no other. Molag Bal crafted this weapon for me \- a tool of immense power. "

Once I enchant it with your powerful soul, it'll command legions. Your soul will make it unstoppable.

Bjorn: 

“You're nothing but a coward, hiding behind Daedric power. But even monsters like you fall.”

Groshak:  
“Ha, go ahead, you'll be just another one digging ebony for bandits. Wouldn't that be hilarious, Bjorn?”

“Come on. Prove it. Let's see if you're as tough as you think you are.”

**and then, Groshak attacks\!**

Taunts:

Haha... You're weak.  
You should've run while you had the chance\!  
I'll crush you like I did with all the others\!

**Molag Bal takes over Groshak's body**

Molag Bal: Stop it\! I've had enough of this\! I'm taking over now.

I am Molag Bal, Lord of Domination, and you are standing in the presence of a power beyond your understanding.

You see, I can give you what you seek. The girl, Adielle, I can bring her back... almost as she was before.

In return, you will serve me, become my champion, and carry out my will across this realm.

Reject me, and I will ensure her soul remains in torment. Choose wisely, mortal.

Player: I need time to think about this.

Molag Bal: Time is a luxury you do not possess. Speak with your companion if you must, but do not keep me waiting long.

If Adielle dies

If Adielle live

After Quest \- Block

Adielle 

I'm not one for grand speeches... but you saved my life. I owe you for that, whether you want me to or not. So from now on, my strength is yours. I’ll be your shadow, a blade at your side… and honestly? Being a vampire… it feels right. Stronger... sharper... I like it.

Player:  
1 \- I didn't do anything Bjorn wouldn't do for me.  
Yes... I believe he would. You two have something rare—trust. I don’t take that lightly. So now, consider me just as bound to you.

2 \- I did this for you, so you can live.  
And live I shall. I won’t waste this second chance. Life… or whatever this is now… is something I intend to make the most of. Thank you.

3 \- So… what are you going to eat?   
Hm, worried about that? You know how many people I cut down... feeding's the least of my worries. Just... let's try to avoid too much sun, alright?

Bjorn:

Don’t doubt the choice you made, alright? I trusted your judgment then, and I trust it now. I’m good with it… more than that, I’m grateful. You’ve kept us going, kept us safe. Whatever comes next, I’ll stand by it—and by you.

\===================================================================

## Bjorn’s Side Quests

### Nemesis 01 \- Gholug the Worm

Player: You seem to want to tell me something.

Bjorn: Well, actually, yes... there's a guy trying to kill me, you know? I heard I killed a bandit he was fond of and he's been going around saying he's going to finish me off… Shame I haven't found him yet because they say he's an Orc with a fine ebony sword…

Player: Kill you? Not if we kill him first.

Bjorn: Ha\! That's the spirit. I heard he was somewhere in the hold of Whiterun, mingling with scum of his kind.

After Kill Gholug:

Hello Bjorn: So, that orc who was baying for my blood, is no more? Gholug the Worm, what a colossal idiot... Ha\! Serves him right, I owe you one.  \- SetStage 30

**Block Dialog**

Haha\! Gholug the Worm, what a colossal idiot\!  
But those ebony swords, they are beautiful blades, aren't they? So, when are you going to give me one?

Option 01  
You can take it from my cold, dead hands. As you once said.  
Hahaha, using my words against me? Fair enough. But remember, it's your arm that'll swing it, not mine.

Option 02  
I'm going to sell them, sorry... I need the gold for some things.  
Ha, okay.... Just make sure they don't end up as trophies on the wall of some milk drinker, eh?  
Those blades should be dispensing justice, you know? Not collecting dust.

Option03  
Of course, I was just about to give you one. It'll protect us better.  
Ha, thank you\! I'll make good use of it. And hey, if you're feeling extra generous, I wouldn't say no to wielding both. I do have a knack for dual-wielding, you know? Modesty aside.

### Nemesis 02 \- Haldor Blackbow

Letter to player:

“To the Slayer of Gholug –

What you did to that vermin caught my eye... I was on his trail for personal reasons, but you got to him first. Curious, isn't it? Your motives remain a mystery to me, but if it's the allure of ebony that guides your hand, then perhaps I can direct your blade once more.

Seek out Haldor Blackbow at Redoran's Retreat, his ebony bow as lethal as it is silent. Many have fallen to his shadows; ensure you're not next.

I know you weren't alone; your mercenary might prove quite useful.

– A Watcher

Courier:  
I've been looking for you. Got something I'm supposed to deliver \- your hands only... This letter, handed to me by a person draped in mystery... cloak and all. Wouldn't say a word...

Player:

Bjorn:  
Let's have a look then... Haldor Blackbow, huh? If this "Watcher" thinks we can be puppeteered into hunting down their enemies, well, they're not entirely wrong, are they? Ha, but we'll be doing this on our own terms... Just say the word, and I'm with you.

The bow:  
That's a truly incredible bow you've got there, eh? I can hardly wait to see some bandits riddled with arrows from it.

### Nemesis 03 \- Dravin Darkgrip

Letter to player:

If you're the hunter I think you are, you'll want to deal with this pest. You handled Haldor Blackbow well, so here's your next target:

Dravin Darkgrip – Lurking in Cragslane Cavern, north of Shor's Stone.  
His life? Forfeit. I leave it to you to collect. When it's done, I'll be watching...

— The Watcher

P.S. Alright, it's me, Little Shadow\! Funny thing \- I've sent a lot of these letters to mercenaries. Quite the coincidence one reached you. Dravin's got ebony weapons, of course, so it's worth the trouble. See you soon.

\======================================================================

Courier:  
I've been looking for you. Got something I'm supposed to deliver \- your hands only…  
Another letter for you. Odd thing, though... same person as before. Cloak and all, still didn’t say a word. Just handed it to me and then—poof—disappeared. It really became invisible, I’m not kidding\!

\======================================================================

Player:  
"Hey, Bjorn, do you remember 'The Watcher'?"  
Bjorn:  
"Ha, Yeah\! How could I forget? All that secrecy, sending us on wild hunts for bandits. What about it?"  
Player:  
"It’s your sister\!"  
Bjorn:  
"What?? You’re serious? So she’s been watching us from the start, pulling the strings..."  
Player:  
"She actually sends a lot of bounty hunters."  
Bjorn:  
"So it was a coincidence, huh? Well, even a blind wolf catches prey once in a while...  Shame I don’t know what she knows. I could’ve been hunting the right bandits all along."  
Player (Option 1):  
"But you still helped clean up Skyrim."  
Bjorn:  
"Yeah, I suppose you’re right. Dead bandits are still dead bandits, after all."  
Player (Option 2):  
"Maybe there’s no 'wrong' bandit to kill."  
Bjorn:  
"True enough. Doesn’t matter what order they fall, as long as they fall."

Player (Option 3):  
"Maybe you should’ve done something else…”

Bjorn:  
"Ha, we all could’ve, but then we’d be bored to death."

\======================================================================

   
Haha\! That was a good one. You keep the gauntlets... My real prize was putting an end to that sorry excuse for a bandit, you know?

\======================================================================

## Barni Adopted

Bjorn: So... when the time comes, when we go after Groshak… do you plan on bringing Barni with us?  
I’ve been thinking about it, and… maybe it’s better if we figure that out now. You know, before we’re standing on the docks with no plan.  
We could leave him with the other orphans... or find somewhere safer. Or... we take him with us.I’m not saying what’s right. Just… I’d rather we choose than let it happen by accident.

Player: I think he should stay with the other orphans.  
Bjorn: Yeah… yeah, maybe that’s best... I just—huh. I keep thinking maybe his father could’ve been better. Maybe I judged him too fast…  
Barni… he deserved more than a sword and a shallow grave between them…

No, Bjorn. I’m sure. We’re taking him to the orphanage.  
"Alright... I get it. Just... tell him it wasn’t his fault. That’s all I ask."  
You're right. I can’t do this. We’ll keep him with us.  
Thank you. I—I didn’t know if you’d see it that way. He needs us more than we think. And maybe... we need him too.

Player: We should leave him somewhere safe.  
That's perfect. Gods, I didn't realize how much I needed to hear that. Barni's seen enough of death already.  
He’s never had a real chance, you know? Not really.Maybe now... he gets to be a kid for the first time.

Maybe you should be the one to tell him. If it comes from you, he won’t feel like he’s being handed off to the next warm bed. He’ll feel wanted.

Actually, love… if we’re doing this together then we should tell him. That he’s not alone anymore. That he has a home now. A real one. With us.

Player: You're staying with us. We're a family now.  
Barni: Really???... You're not just saying that? I... I won’t let you down\! I promise\! I can help and—and I’ll be good, I swear\! You won’t regret it\!

You know… there’s a place we could go. Not just words, I mean. Something sacred. It’s an old tradition. 

Not many know about it anymore… but it means something. You’ve made a good choice. I’m proud of you for it.

If you want... we could take him to the Temple of Kynareth. Let them bless what we've already chosen.

\======================================================================

## Romance Quest

**Romance 01**

Player: Want to know about me?

Bjorn: Ah, well... I reckon I wanted to ask you something too, just like you did before. Have you ever had someone in your life who meant a lot to you?

Player:   
1 \- No, I've always been alone.  
2 \- Yes, I've had someone very special.

Bjorn:   
1 \- Oh, I understand... Being alone can be tough, but solitude can sometimes be a companion that strengthens us, shaping us into who we are. But sometimes, in the depths of the night, one can't help but wonder what it would be like to feel the warmth of another's touch, the passion that ignites between two souls… Oh, maybe I've overstepped my bounds... I'm sorry.  
2 \- Oh, I'm glad to hear that... What happened with them?

Player:   
2-1 \- They passed away, sadly.  
2-2 \- We drifted apart, sadly.

Bjorn:   
2-1-1 \- I'm sorry... that's exactly what I fear, you know? The pain of loss. I'm glad you seem fine now, at least it seems that way. Well... I can't rewrite the past, but I can be by your side in the present. I want you to cherish the old memories and open yourself to make space for the new ones, if that's what you desire. (end dialogue)  
2-2-2 \- Well, for me, that's good to hear. I can be close to you like this... I never really minded being alone. But sometimes, in the depths of the night, one can't help but wonder what it would be like to feel the warmth of another's touch, the passion that ignites between two souls… Oh, maybe I've overstepped my bounds... I'm sorry.

Player: What do you mean by boundaries?

Bjorn: Well... that I am a hired mercenary and should not speak such things, isn't it?

Player: But you mean so much more to me.

Bjorn: Hm... Looks like I've struck a chord with you, haven't I? I guess I mean more to you than I thought…

\======================

**Romance 02**

Player: Why do you look at me like that, Bjorn?

Bjorn: You know, we've been through a lot together... and I can't help but feel close to you. I... I was wondering if... you ever thought about... us?

Player: Us?

Bjorn: Yes, us... more than just companions, more than just friends…  Have you ever... thought about being with me?

Player:   
1 \- Bjorn, are you asking what I think you are?  
2 \- I don't want to have this conversation.

Bjorn:   
1 \- Yes, I... I suppose I am. I'm sorry if that's too forward, but the truth is... I can't stop thinking about it. Not in a vulgar or disrespectful way… But in a way where I yearn to express my feelings for you... not just through words, but through touch, through closeness… I deeply care for you, and I want to share that intimacy. If you're not comfortable with it, I understand... but I had to let you know how I feel…  
2 \- Ah, I see... My apologies... We don't have to talk about anything you're not comfortable with. Let's just carry on as we were, alright?

Player:   
1 \- Well, I... I think I feel the same, Bjorn…  
2 \- I'm sorry Bjorn, I don't want any of that yet.

Bjorn:   
1 \- That's... that's more than I could have hoped for. I want you to know there's no rush, this is a decision that deserves thought… But I can't help but admit, hearing you say that stirs something powerful in me. I'm… I'm consumed by desire for you... When you're ready... I promise, I'll be here…  
2 \- I get it... These things aren't easy, hun, and I'd never want to push you into something you're not ready for. We're good as we are now, and that's enough for me.

**Romance 03**

Player using Mara's amulet:

Player: Bjorn, you seem to want to tell me something…

Bjorn: Well... you know that amulet you're wearing, do you know what it signifies?

Player:   
1 \- Yes, I know what it means.  
2 \- No, it's just an amulet, isn't it?

Bjorn:   
1 \- Oh, so it's a hint, is it? Just so you know, I'm a bit possessive... wouldn't take kindly to anyone else trying to make a move. I'm only kidding, but... not really.  
2 \- Well, it's typically a sign that you're open to... a certain kind of commitment. Marriage, to be precise. I'm not trying to pressure you, just saying... I wouldn't mind if it was a hint for me.

Player: Ah, it could be, couldn't it? Who knows?

Bjorn: Ha... you're quite the joker, aren't you? Well, now being serious. I... I want to take this moment… You know... ever since I met you, you've become my beacon in this harsh world. And if you feel the same... then I want you to know that my heart belongs to you, and only you… I've been a lone wolf for so long, but with you, I've found... a home... I love you. And if you'd have me, I'd stand by your side, for the rest of our days…

Player:   
1 \- Ah Bjorn... I love you too…  
2 \- I love you too, but only as a friend...

Bjorn:  
1 \- Ha... That's beyond words... You made me a very happy man now, you know? I wrote something for you... I was hesitant to give it to you because, well, I'm no bard. But one night, I penned my feelings... I thought maybe you'd like to have it, as a reminder of just how much you mean to me.  
2 \- I... I understand... your friendship means the world to me, and I wouldn't want to lose that...  I promise to restrain myself from now on, okay? You know, there's something I'd like you to have, though. I wrote it during a particularly reflective night. I wrote this thinking of you... it's not very polished, mind you. But it's from the heart. I think I'd still like you to have it.

Poem:

In the hush of Skyrim's night, beneath the shimmering stars,  
My thoughts, they wander to your side, no matter where we are.

A warrior at heart, I've found, my heart does wage a war,  
Against the yearning in my chest, that I can't ignore.

Your laughter, like a melody, echoes in my mind,  
A tune I'd chase through frozen wastes, for you, my precious find.

Your strength, it lights my wayward path, through fear and endless fray,  
And in your eyes, I've found my home, my dawn, my brighter day.

I'm but a simple Nord, my love, my words are rough and plain,  
But know this truth, within my heart, for you, it holds a flame.

In battles fierce, and nights so cold, with you, I've found my rest,  
In every beat, in every breath, for you, my heart beats best.

My raw love, it echoes here, in each and every line,  
An oath I'll sing, to skies above, forever, you'll be mine.

### Heart's Bravest Beat

Hello: Hey... I would like to ask you something when you can, it's important to me...

Act 01

Bjorn: You know, there's a place I've been wanting to visit with you... Have you heard of Bard's Leap Summit?

Player:   
1 \- Yes, I encountered the ghostly bard there\!  
2 \- I haven't been, what's special about it?  
3 \- I've been there, but didn't really explore.

Bjorn:   
1 \- Ah, so you've witnessed the legend yourself\! I'd heard about that, but never witnessed it myself. I'd love to see the spirit of the bard with my own eyes.Besides, I thought it'd be a perfect spot for... a special surprise I've planned for you.

2 \- Ah, it's a location rich with tales and legends. I've heard stories of a ghostly bard who resides there. You know, old stories have always fascinated me and there's something uniquely captivating about this one. Besides, I thought it'd be a perfect spot for... a special surprise I've planned for you.

3 \- Oh, there's a tale of a bard whose spirit still lingers at the summit. I've a deep fondness for stories from the past, and I believe this one is worth exploring together. Plus, I've... let's just say, I've got a particular surprise in store for you there.

\======================================================================

**Romance 05**

Player: So, my love? Where's my surprise?

Well... My love, I brought you here because I know you thrive in the face of challenges... And I've seen you conquer every obstacle that's come your way. There's something I want to share with you here…  
You know, this place tells a tale of a bard named Azzadal. He sang the entirety of the 'Poetic Edda' before daring to take a leap from this very summit. Though his jump was not successful, the place remembers. It resonates with the echo of his spirit and his courage.  
It's a testament to the lengths we go to for the sake of passion and dreams. Just as Azzadal had his dream, I have mine.  
To share a lifetime of challenges and joys with you. Down there, amidst the waters below, lies a surprise for you. A symbol of my commitment, of my dream. I know you're brave enough to take the leap, and when you do, I promise, I'll be right behind you. Because your courage, your spirit... it ignites the same within me.

Player:  
1 \- For you, I'd leap anywhere. Let's do this\!  
2 \- It's a beautiful but I'm not sure about the leap.

Bjorn:   
1 \- Ha... I knew you'd embrace the challenge, love... Not as a test, for I already know your strength, but as a cherished memory we create together... A symbol of the trust we share. Let's do this then\!  
2 \- Ah, well... I understand, my love. It's not about the leap... but our journey together... There's a chest in the waters below with your surprise... Take whichever path you're comfortable with, alright?

(The ring would be a ring that Bjorn's mother used, she kept both hers and his father's after his death because she no longer believed in them. Bjorn took them when she passed away and thinks they might be alive if they had used them, he took them with him when he went looking for his mother. I called it "Bjorn's Bond Ring.")

Bjorn In water: Ha\! That was incredible, wasn't it?

Stage 50

Player: It's a very beautiful ring, Bjorn. I love it\!

Bjorn: Ha, I'm glad you liked it... My mother crafted this ring to shield my father in the throes of war... Yet, he overlooked its worth. When fate took him, she kept both rings together, their essence intertwined. Upon his passing, she gave them to me, whispering hopes that one day I'd find someone to share its protection, its promise.  
Now, they represent a new hope for us. One of these rings is mine, and the other is for you. Regardless of your answer, it's yours to keep. But my deepest wish is for it to become an emblem of our love. Will you marry me?

YES

Player: Bjorn, my love. Yes\! I'll marry you\!

Bjorn: Oh, hearing you say that... it's everything I've ever hoped for. I vow to cherish, honor, and safeguard the love we've built every single day. I love you deeply.

Player: And I love you, Bjorn. With all my heart.

Bjorn: Ha... I''m such a happy man right now, my love... Know that I am, and will always be, yours forever. Whenever you're ready to seal our promise, so am I.

(DG04BjornM\_DG04BjornMarria\_00CF5920\_1)

NO

Player: Bjorn, I'm sorry. I can't.

Bjorn: I... understand. It's just... having you close, but not truly being with you in the way I yearn for... it's too much for my heart to bear. I think it's best if we remain friends. I hope you can understand.

\==========================

Riften

Player: Let's go to the Temple of Mara\!

Bjorn: Aye, my love... As we approach the big moment, I can't help but feel a rush of excitement... The thought of calling you mine... And when night falls, the passion we'll share... I must be the luckiest man in Tamriel, eh?

\===========================

Player: The time is approaching, are you excited?

Bjorn: Ha... Every beat of my heart seems to be racing faster as the moment draws near... It feels like a dream... a really good one. How about you, love? Are you as eager as I am?

Player: Absolutely, I can hardly wait\! / A bit nervous, but so ready\!

Bjorn: Rest assured, hun, nothing in this world could keep me from this moment with you... I'd be here even if my heart were to spill out of my mouth.

\==========================

Player: We're married, my love\!

Bjorn: We're married... isn't that just something? My love, you've come to know me in ways no one else ever has. Since I was a lad, I've been searching for a purpose, a deeper meaning in life... and then, there you were. You brought everything into focus, gave my life the very meaning I sought. Tamriel may never see another soul quite like yours, and by some incredible stroke of luck, you chose me. I vow to honor the trust you've placed in me and to cherish and return your love every day. I love you, deeply and truly.

Player: Forever yours, love. Always and truly.

Bjorn: Hearing you speak like this warms my heart... I want to be worthy of your love. You know, I've never really had a place to call home, as I never planned on settling down. But ever since you told me you loved me, everything changed. I began to dream of a family, of a life together. So I've been saving up, collecting valuables, all with the hope of building a future with you. Now, everything I have is ours – it's here for you, whether you want to use it for something you desire or to help us buy our first home together. Here, take a look at what I've gathered. From now on, what's mine is yours.

Player: Bjorn, that's incredibly touching...

Bjorn: Ah... It's the least I can do for us, love. Here, come in for a warm hug… Hm... It's our fresh start. How about we toast to us at the inn? Some mead, a warm bed... sounds perfect after today, doesn't it?
